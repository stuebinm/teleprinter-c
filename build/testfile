\chapter*{Arya}

\chbegin{\thought{H}}{e is probably thinking}\thought{ he shouldn’t let m'lady go stealing food}. Arya just knew he was going to be stupid now. She wondered why, he would only get himself captured or killed or worse. Tortured maybe. The Queen already wanted him dead, he was lucky to even still be alive. \thought{Maybe he's just too stubborn to die. Stupid bullheaded bastard boy, that's what he is}, she had told herself countless times since they'd left King's Landing.

Yet somehow, she found herself doubting that now. \thought{He figured out that I'm a girl. How stupid can he possibly be?} Still, she knew it didn't matter. When Gendry had that look on his face it meant he was thinking. And Gendry just was \emph{not} very good at thinking. She sighed, then turned back towards him.

\thought{Why is it always me who has to stop him from getting killed?}

\enquote{You're about to do something stupid, aren't you?} 
He seemed startled by her voice, not expecting it. And there was this pained look at his face \emph{again}. Arya wondered how much he could possibly think about her. \thought{Quite a bit, obviously.}

\enquote{I just thought you shouldn’t - }, 
he started, but she cut him of.

\enquote{Just shut up.}

\enquote{But you - }

\enquote{I'm a lady and ladies shouldn’t go stealing food, is that what you think?}

\enquote{I - }

\enquote{Is it?}

\enquote{I – er -- yes.}

She had already known it, of course. It was always that way. No matter how she looked or what she did, they always took her as a lady. How could they all be that stupid and blind? 
\thought{Even Mikken and Harwin and Jory had always treated me as if I was a lady, even when they called me Arya Underfoot, and they all knew how I hated it. Except Jon. And Syrio}. She remembered what Syrio had told her, the trick about looking and seeing what was really there. \thought{Can't they look at me and know that I'm no lady?}

Well, none of them had ever been taught by him, it seemed.

\enquote{Look at me! Someone once told me you should look with my eyes. So when you look at me, what do you see?}

He looked pained.

\thought{Maybe he just noticed how ridiculous he is.}

After a short hesitation, Gendry said, sounding doubtful of his own words:

\enquote{I see a highborn lady in dirty boy's clothes on the road, fleeing from the queen?}

\enquote{What makes you think I'm highborn and a lady, and not just some bastard orphan girl raised in some whorehouse?}

\enquote{You just told me. And you're much too rude to be raised by whores.}

\enquote{I told you to look with your eyes, not with that thick bull's head of yours, stupid. And since when exactly are ladies supposed to be rude?}

He sighed, and she knew she had won. Even someone as bullheaded like him just \emph{had} to see how she looked no different than any other orphan girl smart enough to disguise  herself as a boy as to not to get raped.

\enquote{But it doesn't matter how you look, you're still highborn, m'lady}

\thought{Stupid bastard. Can't he be less stubborn?}

It took her a moment to come up with something different to just make him \emph{see}.

\enquote{Maybe you're right. I'm no bastard like you. I could never be as blind and stupid as you}

\enquote{I - }

\enquote{Oh, just shut up. If we  talk any longer, we'll never see who's living in that village. But we'll go together now. You're too stupid to go alone.}

At least he did not argue any further.

As they got closer to the village, the awful smell grew stronger. Not like the smell of the rotten fish lying near the lake they'd noticed before. It was something ranker, fouler. She rankled her nose, and when she looked beside her, she saw Gendry doing the same.

Soon the woods began to clear out, and they started to use the undergrowth, slipping from bush to bush. She did it as Syrio had taught her, as quiet as a shadow, but with Gendry it was a different matter. It was as if every time he moved, he stepped on fallen branches or leaves or whatever else one could find on the ground that made an awful amount of noise.

\enquote{Can't you be quiet?}, she hissed to him after some time, and even though he softened his steps a bit, Arya still feared every time that someone would hear them, especially after she heard horses, and a man's voice.

The smell did not get any better, either, and she recognised it she'd known before, with Yoren and the others. \enquote{Dead men}, she whispered to Gendry, and he nodded.

A dense thicket of brambles grew just south of the village, where she could see the thatched roofs behind it. Gendry might have seen more, but he would not dare to stand up and look beyond it, least they be noticed. So instead they crept along it until Arya spotted a hole wide enough for her to creep through, and she could see what caused the smell.

The bodies hung right there, beside the peaceful-looking waters of the Gods Eye, the things that had once been men, their feet such as they still had them, still in chains, with crows pecking at their bare flesh flapping from corpse to corpse. And for every crow, there seemingly were a hundred flies swarming all around the dead. When the wind blew from the lake, she could see the corpses swinging, heard the chains that bound them to the wood rattle.

The one closest was missing an arm, and the crows had eaten most of his face, and Arya could see the bone beneath it. Its throat and chest had been ripped open, and she could see the entrails and ragged flesh dangling out from where it had been opened.

She made herself look at the one beside him, and the one beside him, and the one beside that one as well, telling herself she was as hard as stone. The corpses were all so savaged and torn apart, she had not even realized they had been stripped before now. They did not \emph{look} like naked people, they did not even look like men at all. Their eyes, and sometimes the whole of their faces were missing, eaten by the crows, and many of them lacked arms or legs. One had been ripped apart entirely, and all that remained for Arya to see was a single leg, still chained and dangling slightly in the wind.

\thought{Fear cuts deeper then swords.}

The corpses could not hurt them, but whoever had put them there could. Well beyond the gibbets were  two men leaning on their spears in front of a long house beside the lake. A pair of tall poles had been driven into the mud there, with two banners drooping from them, both of them so pale that it was hard to make out what colour they had been, but it looked to Arya as if one was supposed to be red, and the other maybe yellow or orange.

\thought{I don't need to see their banners to know they're Lannisters}, she thought, \thought{Robb would never do this, who else slaughters peasants but the Lannisters?}

She crawled back through the hedge, ignoring the thorns that bit into her skin.

\enquote{And?}, Gendry whispered, \enquote{What did you see?}

\enquote{Lannisters}, was all she said.

Thankfully, for once he was not too stupid and knew what she meant.

They would have to be as far away from here before sunrise as they could manage.


\chapter*{Gendry}

\chbegin{G}{endry had never been this exhausted,} not even after long days spent hammering on metal at Master Mott's forge. Around him the others slept, as worn out from their flight as he was, after half a night and a day spent running away from the Gods Eye. Arry said they should go east, and he supposed that they \emph{had} gone roughly eastwards, but the truth was that none of them had really cared.

They'd just run as far away as it was possible for boys raised in a city, one of whom had to be almost carried, and a little two-year old girl.

\thought{Well, three boys and two girls.} He tried not to think about that too much.

She was asleep, too, lying not far from him next to a fallen tree that she used as a shelter, with a softly-snoring Weasel next to her.

Gendry was quite grateful that the young one slept as deep as she did, what with all her crying during the day.

Lommy was lying next to a tree, with Hot Pie beside him. A day ago, Lommy had been hardly able to walk, now he had to lean on one of the others at the best of times. At the worst, he and Hot Pie had to carry him.

\thought{Surprisingly heavy, that one.}

That was about everything he remembered. The day had gone by in a blur of hurrying through the woods, tripping over high-standing roots, slipping on wet leaves and into mud, trying not to let Lommy fall to the ground combined with the sound of Weasel crying and Arry trying to get a sense of direction while talking about moss on trees.

\thought{Arya}, he had to correct himself, \thought{her name's Arya. Arya \emph{Stark}.}

He had tried not to think about that during the day, yet now, while he was desperate to stay awake and guard their camp - or what he'd called camp, mostly to make Lommy and Hot Pie feel safer, and perhaps even to make things easier for Arya - she kept worming her way into his thoughts.

\thought{Worming. Worms.} She'd eaten worms again, today. Tried to make them eat some, too, since they had nothing else. After Hot Pie had taken one and thrown up immediately thereafter, Gendry had chosen to go hungry.

\thought{Why am I thinking about worms again? I'm too tired for this, I can't think straight, and I should be watching out for them.}

He shook his head a few times, took in a deep breath of the uncomfortably cold air, and imagined to feel a bit more alert.

\thought{Right. Arry's a lady pretending to be a street-girl pretending to be a boy for the Night's Watch while running from the king and is actually called Arya Stark.}

That sounded ridiculous, even in his head. If he said that out loud, he thought he might just burst out laughing.

Of course he'd known that \emph{something} was up with her.

\thought{Why couldn't she be a starving girl hoping to go unnoticed to get food? Or some kind of witch or assassin-in-training hiding with them. Or a wildling soon-to-be-spearwife?}

Worse, it even kind of made sense. In a way. More than the spearwife, at least. The way she spoke, for example, so different from how one normally spoke in King's Landing, yet he'd never thought about that. He'd just figured she wasn't from King's Landing.

\thought{Though that's not even wrong.}

Why did he feel that was funny? He was pretty sure that nothing should be funny right now, with them on the run. \thought{Can you be drunk on sleeplessness?}

\thought{Sleeplessness. Funny word. Sounds like some fancy thing that a highborn might say.}

Arya hadn't, thought, at least not when he heard her.

\thought{Has her father, maybe?}

No. He didn't think Lord Stark had used the word \emph{sleeplessness}, the one time he'd spoken with him.

\thought{Wait, what? Oh, seven hells.}

Her father. Of course Lord Stark was her father, why hadn't he thought of that during the day? Now that he thought about it, he'd even looked similar, and spoke similar, too.

How had he missed that? Of course he'd known of Lord Stark's treason, of his execution and everything, and wondered why both Hands who'd visited him ended up dead, but had figured that it just was bad luck on his part. That wouldn't be anything new, he'd never had too much luck.

He'd also thought about how Arya must be fleeing because they named her father a traitor.

He just hadn't realised that it was the same person who'd visited him. Well, part of him had, obviously, and just now decided to let the rest of him know.

That sounded stupid, even to him.

\thought{Stupid}, she'd called him. Maybe she was right.

Still, he was the one who was currently guarding her and the others, no matter if he was a stupid bastard or not.

\thought{Guarding, yes.} He'd said he'd take the first watch. Not that he could do much, of course, but it made him feel \emph{safe}.

\thought{Watching, yes, I should be watching if there's anything dangerous.} Suddenly the feeling of being stuck behind a hedge while Arry described dangling corpses to him came back, making fear creeping all over him again.

He looked into the darkness around him, stared intensely on that one big large tree in front of him, with that nasty root that he knew must be somewhere there because it had thrown him and Hot Pie to the ground earlier, making Lommy crying out in pain as he fell into the dirt.

He stared and stared, yet could not find it.

Trying to search for it was no luck, he decided, and stared instead at the slightly darker tree a little behind the other one, just barely visible in the moonlight, and the fear hit him again.

\thought{What if we didn't make it far enough?}

What if he fell asleep, just to wake up and find himself surrounded by murderous knights?

Suddenly he believed to hear a horse in the darkness, could almost see it, just barely hidden by the shadows, could hear voices of men shouting things like \thought{Here they are!} and \thought{You didn't really think you'd gotten away, did you?}

\thought{Things. You're seeing things, they're not real, you're just making them up.}

Then a wolf started to howl, and that most definitely \emph{was} real, and Gendry wondered whether it would be better to be eaten by a wolf or to be tortured to death.

When he finally lost his battle against exhaustion and fell into an uneasy sleep, he was desperately afraid.

And as if to mock him, he woke up with Arry's face hovering in front of his eyes.

\enquote{Get up, stupid!}

It took him a moment to realize what she just said. Then he tried to stand up, nearly fell down again, and found to his surprise that she'd caught him. Well, almost. He was to heavy for her to hold, so she fell down with him.

Hot Pie looked at them for a moment, then burst out laughing, while both of them got up and decided not to talk about it. Instead, Gendry made Hot Pie stop by reminding him that they'd have to carry Lommy again, and not long afterwards, everything was almost as it was the day before, with the possible exception that Gendry thought Weasel might be crying a \emph{bit} less then before, and that Lommy could walk even less on his own.

Arya again tried to get them walking towards east, and he imagined that she might even have succeeded.

Lommy again was surprisingly heavy for a sick young boy, and again talked a surprising amount about how they should have yielded for food, at least for someone who whimpered every time he took a step.

He was about to give up on the day entirely when Arya suddenly ran off and disappeared between the trees, with both Gendry and Hot Pie shouting for her to come back, and Weasel sobbing louder again once she no longer saw her.

\thought{Great.}

She had been against leaving the others behind when he suggested it, and Gendry hoped that she still thought the same. Otherwise neither of them would last long. Certainly not Lommy, nor Weasel neither, and he'd bet his bull's head helmet that Hot Pie had no idea where they were.

He certainly had none.

The truth was, and he hated to admit it, they all depended on a little girl hiding from the King to get them anywhere, and even then they'd probably just die somewhere else.

And now that little girl was gone.

Just as he realized that he was indeed very thoroughly lost now, he heard movement and branches cracking, and Arya come back with her sword in one hand, with blood still on it, and a rabbit in the other, its little entrails hanging out in a crude manner.

\enquote{Sorry}, she said, \enquote{but we need food, and I just saw that one and - well. Does anyone now how to make fire?}

\enquote{You don't?}

\enquote{No? Why should I do?}

Gendry supposed he shouldn't be so surprised that she didn't.

Just as he thought they'd have to eat it raw, Hot Pie supplied \enquote{I know. Well, I've got me some ideas. You need fire in an oven, and I watched the men making it with the Night's Watch. It's simple really. Just take a stick, then - }

Arya cut him off.

\enquote{All right, you know, talk about it when we make camp, we've still got one or two hours.}

Hot Pie groaned, and Lommy gave something like a soft whimper.

\enquote{What? I don't want to be captured. If you want to, just stay here.}

Gendry wasn't happy either, but knew Arry was right.

It worked out surprisingly well for them. With roughly an hour left till sunset, the woods gave away to fields, with a village at their far end.

Or what had been a one, anyway. The fields were burned and dead, and the houses themselves consisted of a few black walls, great lumps of ash lying around it with smaller chimps of burned wood and clay everywhere on the ground. At least no one would notice their little fire between the still-smoking parts of it.

The leg of the rabbit he got to eat was the most wonderful thing he'd ever tasted, together with the water they drank from a little stream running through the village. Afterwards, the sun had set and they figured they'd have to spend the night there or somewhere close nearby.

Hot Pie was determined to stay inside the village, and Lommy refused to be separated from him, even after Arya had told both of them that it wasn't safe there. Even burned, someone could still come by and hope there was something left, and if that someone found them …

But Hot Pie wouldn't listen.

In the end she gave up and they both decided to sleep outside, hidden in the woods just far enough so no one would see them from the fields, while Hot Pie and Lommy would sleep amongst the ruins. Gendry thought that dangerously stupid, but it gave him a nice opportunity to talk with Arya without being overheard.

Well, if one didn't count Weasel, but she couldn't exactly speak.

He wasn't much of a talker, so he decided to just start with the obvious.

\enquote{You've got an idea where we're going?}

\enquote{East}, she said, \enquote{We'll come across the Kingsroad somewhere, then follow it north.}

\enquote{And then? We can't walk all the way to the Wall, we'll either be killed or just starve on our own.}

She looked uncertain for a moment, then said \enquote{We won't. And we don't have to go to the Wall either. Winterfell is much closer, we could go there. Or Riverrun, we'd be safe there}

\enquote{Because - err …}

\enquote{Because they're my brother's and uncle's castles. They'll keep us safe.}

\thought{No, they'll keep \emph{you} safe. They won't give a damn about the likes of me or Hot Pie.}

\enquote{Oh, right, I forgot. Sorry, \emph{m'lady}}

\enquote{Stop that!}, she snapped.

\enquote{But you \emph{are} a lady! No matter what you say, you are, and that's why you want to go to whatever castle, because \emph{you} will be safe there. \emph{M'lady.}}

Anger swept through him while something in the back of his head noticed he was shouting, and that shouting wasn't \emph{exactly} a good idea while on the run, but he didn't care anymore.

\enquote{\emph{You} will be safe there, because you're highborn, and these others will take you in, because \emph{they} are, too, and everything'll be fine for you, but not for me, or for Hot Pie, or anyone else, because we're only stupid bastard lowborns who nobody gives a shit about, but you won't care with all your \emph{real} friends all 'round you, you'll - }

Suddenly his cheek hurt, and he realized she must've slapped him.

\enquote{Stop it, \emph{Gendry!}}, she snapped again, yet this time it somehow managed to sound \emph{pleading.}

He stared at her, puzzled.

\enquote{I \emph{do} care}, she told him, her voice softer, more in line with the pleading look she gave him, \enquote{Just because no one else doesn't ever think about you doesn't mean that I don't. Just that everyone else is stupid.}

\enquote{Oh, right, so \emph{you} care about me, then? Plenty of good that'll do me when I'm starving to death outside while you're in a bloody \emph{nice warm castle}!}

\enquote{\emph{Stop it!} I said I care about you, and when we get to Riverrun, whoever's there will care about \emph{me}, and I'll tell them to let you stay.}

\enquote{An they'll let us stay if you say so?}

Arya bit her lip. \thought{Oh, great.}

\enquote{I hope. I'll say something, that you saved me or something, that you brought me there, that I'd have been captured otherwise, maybe that I'd be dead if not for you, they can't just ignore it, they'll listen, they'll - }

\enquote{Oh, right. Of course, everyone's believing that. Of course we saved you, because a cripple, a baker and a blacksmith are so great at saving people.}

\enquote{And? Better than nothing. Besides, I wouldn't even be lying. Well, not \emph{all} the time. I probably \emph{would} be dead or captured if I'd've been alone.}

That made him pause.

\thought{Yes, I suppose she's right. I'd be dead too, without her. Strange.}

He'd have to think on that. Well, he had all night.

\thought{Probably not the whole night. Another day like this, and I'll die of lost sleep.}

The hours he'd stayed awake last night hadn't done him any good, and in case anyone found them, what was he supposed to do? He had a nice big sword, all right, but no idea on how to use it.

\thought{Arya has more ideas on that}, he supposed, \thought{she caught the rabbit, after all.}

Still, he tried to stay awake for a bit after that while the others slept, thinking about him and Arya and Hot Pie, even Weasel who lay next to Arya again, and Lommy back at the farm, his leg getting worse with every moment.

\thought{Was it wrong to let them sleep there? Someone might come to look if there's anything left to raid, if there's some coins that survived the fire.}

Then he realised that thought was stupid. Coins were either made of copper or silver, not iron, and would've melted easily in that fire.

\emph{Then} he realized that he only knew that because he'd been smithing half his life, and that not everyone was a smith.

Something hit him, violently ripping him from his thoughts. Yet when he jumped to his feet, ready to go down with a fight, no one was there. Only Weasel, lying on the ground next to a fallen tree, the bones of the rabbit they'd eaten, and Arya, struggling in her sleep.

\thought{Struggling. Lashing out. As if she's trying to keep something away from her.}

He sat down next to her, and saw tears on her cheeks.

\thought{She's crying in her sleep.}

Nightmares. Gendry was no stranger to them. He'd had them almost as long as he could remember. About his mother, about a man shouting at him, about the Goldcloaks.

And the sea, and the feeling of drowning.

\thought{Think of something else, stupid.} It was no good to ponder on these memories.

Sobbing filled his ears, and when he looked at her he could see the tears flowing, her body struggling against some unseen captor.

\thought{Should I wake her up?}

Maybe it would help, for a moment, but what if she'd just continue dreaming afterwards? What if she didn't \emph{want} him to intrude on her sleep, if she'd be furious at him?

He looked at her again, still trying to escape her captor, then resolved to wake her up.

Kneeling next to her he shook her, softly, slowly, waking her.

\enquote{Arya}, he whispered, not too loud. He didn't want to wake Weasel as well.

He fancied to hear a \enquote{No}, though whether it was meant for him or for something in her dream he could not say. Then she opened her eyes, looked at him for a moment, her face the very image of confusion.

\enquote{Gendry?}, she stared at him.

\thought{What am I supposed to do now?}, he almost panicked.

\enquote{You, ahm, you were - struggling. In your sleep. Sorry, I thought you might - er}

She nodded faintly, which he supposed he could interpret as either a \emph{thank you} or as just \emph{I know}, and fell asleep again immediately thereafter.

He waited for a bit, but she didn't move again in her sleep.

Hopefully, his own sleep would be as devoid of nightmares as hers was now.

It turned out to be indeed better than it had been the night before, but again he woke to the sight of Arya's face above his, telling him to get up.

To his horror, he saw the sun was already high in the sky.

\enquote{Why didn't you wake me earlier? We would've been - }

\enquote{Doesn't matter, Gendry. Lommy can't walk, so we wouldn't get very far anyways.}

\enquote{Lommy can't walk?}

He wondered if that was really as shocking as he thought it was; Lommy had become weaker and weaker and the gash in his leg uglier and uglier during the last days. He had always been clinging to one of them as to not fall down, but if he couldn't walk \emph{at all …}

\enquote{No, but Hot Pie's found food.}

Her face light up a bit, though it seemed forced. In her left hand was a carrot, Gendry saw, one end good, the other burned black.

\enquote{Looks like only everything above ground burned. Everything that grows \emph{in} the earth is still good. Well, almost, and it tastes all wrong even if you wash it first, but it's better than nothing. Here.}

She gave it to him, and Gendry broke his fast on a half-burned carrot washed in the stream running through the field, next to the village, that they'd used to drink the day before.

\enquote{Hot Pie's running all around the rest of the fields, looking for whatever else is there. I looked, too. Found a chicken, could even eat half a wing, but the rest was just ash. I'll show you. We've got all day. No one will suspect there's anyone in the ruins, and even if, we can always slip back into the woods. We'll get enough food for a few days, and maybe Lommy will get a little better, but …}

\thought{More like he's going to die}, he finished for himself.



\chapter*{Arya}

\chbegin{T}{he meat was the best Arya had ever tasted.} It wasn't anything special, not really. In fact, probably every other highborn lady would be offended if you tried to set it before her, and Sansa would scream and run away from it. Still, Arya found that a bit of more-or-less roasted and more-or-less raw pork and chicken, which was infinitely better than all-raw rabbit, together with carrots and turnips made for a surprisingly rich midday meal. Back at Winterfell, there had been food twice as fine as this every day, and yet Arya had never found it quite as good.

The others may think her not as hungry as them, after she'd eaten these worms, but they didn't fill her belly as much as she'd like. Mostly, they just helped to convince herself that at least she hadn't eaten \emph{nothing}. Still, she supposed she was less hungry than the others.

The day had been easy on them all, but Arya knew they could not stay in the ruined village for too long. Despite what she'd told the others, someone \emph{would} come by, and she wasn't sure if they'd be quick enough to hide, and most certainly they'd loose Lommy. But they couldn't go on either, or they'd die before making it near Riverrun or even just the Trident. She hoped Robb was there, or someone else from Winterfell to recognise her. It had been bad enough in King's Landing, when she'd had to convince the guards to let her in again, after she'd sneaked out of the keep.

There was nothing to help it. Going on would mean leaving Lommy behind, and Weasel too, most like. The girl wasn't really quick at walking yet, and half the time Arya had to carry her. That would slow them down, except, of course, Lommy already made them even \emph{slower}. She knew she'd be quicker alone, or maybe together with Gendry. He'd suggested as much, after all. If she could take him with her, and reach the Trident, maybe - 

\thought{No}, she told herself, \thought{I won't leave the others.}

She didn't want to be like Cutjack and Tarber, who'd left \emph{them} behind. Her father had said that alone she'd die, and she'd already admitted as much to Gendry. And Hot Pie was the only one who knew how to start a fire, and he wouldn't leave Lommy, so they had to stay together anyways.

\thought{Lommy.} Hot Pie knelt beside him, trying to feed him something. He couldn't move at all anymore, so Gendry had used his helmet as a bucket to bring him water while she and Hot Pie had searched for food. There was surprisingly much, quite a lot more than they could've hoped for, enough for a week at the very least, that they'd laid on a set of relatively clean stones in one of the ruins.

\thought{If we can carry all of it.}

What a strange problem. For days they'd been starving, and now suddenly there was too much to carry.

Before their improvised midday meal, when the food started to pile up even \emph{after} they'd removed the more burned bits, they figured it was probably best to eat as much of the rest as they could now, so they might last a bit longer.

So now they all sat (well, except for Weasel, who'd started to run around after she'd eaten enough and now seemed surprisingly happy for a girl who normally wouldn't do much more than constantly crying) on the floor around their new-found supplies, and for once were uncaring enough to let Hot Pie go on about how to bake cakes and make soups for ages.

Arya had half a mind to use Gendry's helmet as a kettle and try one of his recipes, but then she'd probably just ruin the metal, and it was already tasty enough for her anyways.

Still, it was a good distraction from the fact that she'd no idea about what they'd do now, with Lommy unable to walk, and it kept her from thinking about her father. She did that enough at night in her dreams, she didn't really want to do it at day, too.

Even Lommy seemed a bit happier, and when Hot Pie paused for a moment, he himself started talking about how he used to dye wool, back in King's Landing. Very slowly, in a weak, pained voice and frequent stops, yet no one cared about that, happy enough that he could talk at all.

All in all, it was a surprisingly pleasant day, and though none of them really knew what to do, they were all able to ignore that for a while. After midday Gendry asked whether she'd be willing to teach him how to use a sword (they still had those that Yoren had given them, from the Goldcloaks at the inn, and Gendry had brought a relatively straight branch that could double as a practice sword).

He used an overly formal tone and called her \emph{m'lady} again, making Arya chuckling and annoyed at the same time, before she realized they should check if Hot Pie was near enough to listen.

\enquote{You know, you really shouldn't talk like that}, she told him, \enquote{What if Hot Pie hears?}

She'd already spent hours hoping no one had noticed her shouting for Winterfell during Ser Amory's attack, there was no need to make it even worse.

\enquote{Why do you want to spar with me, anyways? Last time I offered, you weren't very eager.}
\thought{And you weren't too bad with that sword at the Gods Eye, either}, she thought, though she wouldn't admit that to him.

\enquote{I'm not asking for fighting, m'lady. Just about hunting. It's no good if only one of us is able to actually \emph{catch} something, is all, m'lady.}

\enquote{Not much to teach, really. Just don't try to hammer your game into the ground, it's not steel on an anvil. Just try it out, you've got a stick, imagine that treestump over there is something you want to catch. And stop talking like that!}

She might have been amazed at his ability to switch between treating her as just another boy and a lady without ever getting it wrong in front of the others if just hadn't been this \emph{infuriating}.

He brought his stick down on it, hitting it so hard it almost broke, before he continued talking:

\enquote{Well, but you're still - }

\enquote{Yes, all right, I \emph{am} highborn, got a last name and a sigil and all, but you know what? I don't really care about it. Well, I do, a bit, I do care about my brothers and my sister and my mother and father} - Her voice was a bit shaky for a moment, but she caught herself quickly - \enquote{but I don't really care about being highborn. You know, I've got a brother.}

\enquote{Yes, I know, he's currently fighting a war as King o' the North, or something like that.}

\enquote{What? - Oh, yes, he's my brother, too, but I didn't mean him. I've got another one, Jon Snow.}

She waited for a moment, till Gendry noticed the last name \emph{Snow}.

\enquote{I never cared, and never understood why others would. Father didn't really care, either, and raised him at Winterfell. He's my brother as much as Robb is - he's the one you thought of - and he's always been the better friend, too. And he never called me \emph{lady}. He even got a wolf, too.}

Uncertainty crossed Gendry's face, then changed into confusion.

\enquote{A wolf? You mean, like a wooden toy one, or one made of iron?}

\enquote{What?} she hadn't expected Gendry to ask about \emph{that.} Maybe more about who Jon was, or what they'd done at Winterfell, or maybe even who his mother was. Arya hadn't even realized she'd mentioned Ghost. \enquote{No, a real one. We all had one. Well, actually, not real wolves, but direwolves. Jory said they probably were the only ones south of the Wall, but my brothers just found them as pups near a road. Their mother died, so we took them to Winterfell. We wanted to take them south with us, but Joffrey wanted Nymeria dead, so I had to chase her away, and then Queen Cersei just had Lady killed instead, even though she didn't even do anything.}

He stared at her for a moment, then gave her a look that might've meant something like \emph{you're mocking me.}
\enquote{Nymeria?}

\enquote{My wolf. Sansa's - she's my sister - called hers Lady. Robb's is Grey Wind, Rickon's Shaggydog.} She wondered if Bran had named his wolf by now. Father had told her that he'd woken up, after all, so maybe his wasn't nameless anymore. She'd have to reach Riverrun, to find out. \enquote{Jon's named his one Ghost, because he's white as snow and never makes a sound.}

The staring continued for a moment, then he went back to hacking his stick on the treestump as if it was meat to be butchered, making Arya almost laugh.

\enquote{Not like that. Try holding the stick different, not like a hammer. More like this} - she showed him - \enquote{and you really don't have to cut the tree in half, Gendry.}

They spend a large part of the afternoon like this with even Hot Pie eventually joining in for a moment, and Weasel grabbed a short burned stick she'd found on the ground and started thrashing it on everything she saw until it broke, at which point she started to cry again and they had to stop.

\thought{It's almost sundown anyway. We could use some sleep.}

This time though, Arya resolved to stay with Lommy and Hot Pie in the burnt village, trying to make herself comfortable on the ash-covered ground. Her back was soon completely black, and washing herself in the stream wouldn't be too easy when Hot Pie might see her, but she didn't want to leave them again.

\thought{A pack should stay together}, she thought, again remembering her father telling her about how the lone wolf would die.

Lommy had been asleep during half the day already, and Hot Pie and Weasel were fast asleep, too - in Weasel's case cuddling against the boy after he'd tried to sing her something that might have been a nursery rhyme. 

Gendry soon followed, and Arya tried to, too, but soon found herself afraid again of everything, from nightmares about her father to what they'd do on the morrow. So instead, she tried to picture the maps she'd so often seen in Winterfell's library, where, whenever they couldn't go outside because of rain or snow or storm, she'd read about Nymeria who'd conquered Dorne and Visenya, Aegon's Warrior Queen, and sometimes about the Wildlings, too. Jon had known something about maps, too, she remembered. He'd draw them on the dirty floor in the broken tower, and they'd pretend that small stones were their armies trying to conquer the other's land. Sometimes they read accounts of real wars beforehand, and tried to replay them, too, thought that seldom worked out as it was supposed to. She remembered having long arguments about whether Nymeria or Daeron the Young Dragon was better. Arya had always thought that pointless, since it was \emph{obvious} that Nymeria had done better. Unlike the latter, she hadn't lost everything again in a fortnight, after all.

Later, she tried to find the Ice Dragon in the sky for a while, to be certain which way was north, but the trees were to close and to high to see anything and she didn't want to leave the ruin in search of a better place to watch.

Then she listened to the wolves howling for a while, wondering where Nymeria might be now.

In the end, she figured they could need a guard, and resolved to stay awake as long as possible, until she almost fell on Gendry while trying to stand upright and watch over what remained of the walls.

He stirred, and even though Arya hadn't really touched him that much, he woke up, looking up at her.

\enquote{Arry?}

By now, Arya liked it when he called her that. It was a stupid name, and she didn't really like pretending to be a boy, but he never called her \emph{m'lady} when he used \emph{Arry} first.

He blinked in confusion, looking at the black sky before turning his head back to face hers.

\enquote{What are you doing? It's the middle of the night.} - Slowly, his voice went from sleepy to alert - \enquote{Why are you still awake?}

\enquote{Can't sleep.} \thought{Don't want to sleep. Don't want to see father standing there again, and the crowds cheering for Joffrey.} \enquote{And I thought, well, wouldn't be bad if someone's keeping a watch.}

Sitting up, Gendry looked at her for a moment, his face having that thinking expression again.

Softly, he said, \enquote{You know … if you want to talk 'bout it …}

\enquote{About what? I just can't sleep, that's all. There's nothing wrong with me.}

\enquote{Arya, I've seen you sleeping, remember? Last night, I woke you after you thrashed 'round while asleep.}

She honestly couldn't remember that, though she \emph{did} remember having nightmares.

\thought{That's not fair, why should he know? It's my own business what I'm dreaming about.}

\enquote{And come on, I'm not stupid. I know who your father was, and I - ahm - I know how it feels.}

Suddenly anger was rushing through her.

\thought{No you don't! You don't know how I feel, you can't know, you - }

\enquote{Arya}, he interrupted her. \thought{Did I just say that out loud?} From the look on Gendry's face she might have even shouted it out loud. She really \emph{was} tired, but - 

\enquote{Maybe you're right. Maybe I don't know. I never lost my father at an execution, I never even had one, after all. But … you know, my mother got sick and died within a few days, and I know how \emph{I} felt then, with nothing I could do …}

Briefly, uncertainty crossed his face.

\enquote{Well, I just thought … I never had someone to talk about it, then, and I think that maybe it would've helped … and if you … well, just know I'll listen to you, if you want to.}

He used her moment of confusion to lay her down on something that was probably ash, then said:

\enquote{But now you sleep. Don't know what we're going to do on the morrow. Come on, you'll be safe. I'll watch out for you now, no one can do that all night.}

She nodded slightly, though she didn't know if it was to thank him or just agreeing that no one could stay up all the time. She truly \emph{was} tired. No matter her fear of nightmares, after she'd laid down on the ground her eyes closed within a minute.

And while she did see her father again for a moment, and Ilyn Payne with Ice above him, these images quickly faded and gave way to a forest, deep and dark, but as comforting to her as if it were her home. She ran, with her little cousins all around her, through bushes and over crooked roots. When the trees gave away to fields there was a village in the distance, at the shore of a lake that she'd never seen before, but that was still familiar to some part of her. Some of the men-made rocks had broken down into little hills of stones and wood, but at the center stood a keep she'd seen before, with blood on its walls. She felt a scent that was well-known to her, yet hard to distinguish from the many different others.

\thought{Where's she gone?}, she wondered, \thought{how can it be that her paths ends her yet she is not dead? Where could she go?}

Arya woke with a start, and found herself still on a heap of ash in the ruin, where Gendry had placed her last night. The sky was bright with the sun already high, and she found Lommy lying not far from her, next to something that might have been a chest, once.

She looked for Gendry and Hot Pie, and for a terrible moment she feared they might have left her behind until she found the bull's head helmet.

\thought{Gendry wouldn't go without that.}

That made her feel safer again, and she continued to look at her surroundings. The heap of food was still there, too, and she noticed that someone - probably Gendry - had stuffed the helmet full with it. Maybe he thought it was easier to carry this way, and she had to agree. They already had their swords, and neither scabbards nor belts to fast them on, it would be hard to hold much in only one hand.

As she stood up and looked down on herself to see how black her clothing was - it was so dark that no one would notice if she'd suddenly walk into the hall at Castle Black and talk to Jon, she decided - she heard someone call her name.

\enquote{Arry}, someone called for her, in a voice so low and weak she didn't even recognize it at first. 

\thought{Lommy.} His voice had grown impossibly weaker since he'd told them how to dye wool the day before.

Turning around to kneel beside him, she saw he was as pale as a corpse, with his leg an infected ruin of blood and flesh. She could even see a bone. In a crude way, he reminded her of the bodies the Lannisters had hung at the gallows.

\thought{He'd be the same if we'd gone to them.} Was there truly so little she could do? She didn't really like him, of course, but that didn't mean she wanted him to \emph{die}.

\enquote{We should've yielded.}

\enquote{I told you they wouldn’t help us. They would've killed us.}

\enquote{I'd better be dead than like this. Useless. You were right, Arry. I can't hunt no boars. I just … I guess I want you know that before I die.}

\enquote{Don't say that. You're \emph{not} going to die.}

\enquote{I am. Don't lie. I'm good as dead. If I'm not dying, Kurz ain't be dead, too.}

\thought{He's right},she realised, \thought{Kurz was a lot stronger and he still died.} Arya wasn't stupid, she knew Lommy would probably die, had even said as much to Gendry - but telling that to Lommy \emph{himself} was more difficult than she could have thought.

\enquote{You. Are. Not. Going. To. Die.}

\enquote{I am. And I'd rather have it quickly.} He sounded terrible then, using what little strength he still had to try and sound confident, but all Arya could hear was the fear he tried to hide beneath it.

\enquote{What do you - }

\enquote{It hurts, Arry. I feel like I'm dead, but I ain't. Not quite. I just want it to be over. You got a sword}, he tried to turn his head towards Needle, \enquote{Just do it.}

Her breath seemed to fail as she realised what he asked of her. \thought{He wants me to kill him. He \emph{wants} to die.}

\enquote{I can't kill you. I'll help you. We'll find a maester or …}

\enquote{Maesters ain't helping me live, Arry, and you can't. But you can help me dying, at least.}

\enquote{I can't.} \thought{I can't just kill him. It's \emph{wrong}.}

\enquote{I was hopin' you'd do it. You were the one beating Hot Pie bloody. You fought best at that village. If anyone can, then you.}

\enquote{That was different. Hot Pie bullied me. These men attacked us. They were a threat. You're an injured cripple. I can't just kill you.}
\thought{Though it would be easier for us then. But it's wrong. Father would hate me if I did that.}

\enquote{Think about it?}, he begged. She thought he said something else as well, but his voice was so low then that she couldn't hear anymore.

\enquote{I will}, she promised, if only to make him feel better.

She remained silent after that. Remembering that a year ago, when she'd dreamt of living with the Wildlings she'd searched for things that might be useful in Maester Luwin's books - he always let her read them, would sometimes explain things she didn't understand, she'd never thought she'd miss him so much - books that explained how one could find a way without a map, she tried to think about that, apply everything she still knew, but it didn't work. Every time she did something, Lommy's words came back to her.

\thought{You can help me dying, at least.}

It was as if they haunted her, during the day. Gendry came to her, and they talked about how best to go to Riverrun, a boy who'd never been outside his city and a girl who only had a vague recollection of the maps at Winterfell, but again it didn't help. Finding that she was unable to think straight, she returned to the fields and stables around the village and again searched if there was anything they'd overlooked, as Hot Pie had done all day, but it was no use.

\thought{I can't just kill him.}

She tried talking to Hot Pie, too, but every time it seemed to end up with both of them complaining about something little and unimportant, and neither really listening to what the other said. When she ran out of ideas, she even tried to speak with Weasel, but of course that was of no use. The girl couldn't talk, after all, even though she didn't look \emph{that} much younger than Rickon.

When the sun finally began to set, Lommy had stayed at the same spot during the entire day, not even moving to turn around and lay on his other side. She wondered how it was possible for him to look even worse than earlier, which somehow managed to do. 

When they sat down next to him to eat a bit, it seemed almost unnaturally silent. None of them had ever talked much, of course, but now it was just …

Arya didn't want to talk about anything, not with Lommy lying there next to them, fading in and out of sleep. Hot Pie didn't seem to want, either, and Gendry wore his thinking face again.

\enquote{What's wrong?}, he asked after some while. Hot Pie didn't say anything, and Arya wasn't keen to, either.

Gendry did not press the matter and stayed silent, almost as if he did not expect an answer at all, until she decided to tell him the truth. She wondered how he did that, making her talk by saying absolutely nothing.

\enquote{Lommy asked me to kill him}, she admitted.

Hot Pie looked up, surprised and seemingly shocked.

\enquote{He asted me th'same yesterday. Tried to get it out o' his head, I did, but he ain't listening to me anymore.}

\enquote{Same with me}, Arya told him. \enquote{I can't kill him. I told him I'd find help, but he said I couldn't help him to live, so I should help him to die}

Hot Pie looked crestfallen and didn't say anything anymore, while Gendry's thinking face now seemed to be mixed with something else. \thought{Pain, maybe}, she thought, \thought{or grief.} She wondered what he was thinking about.

After a long while, he said: \enquote{I told you, Arry, he's going to die. There's nothing we can do. If that's what he really wants …}

\enquote{So you'd do it?}, Arya asked him.

\enquote{Not sure. But I think maybe … I'd ask the same. When I'd be sure I won't have long.}

She'd never even thought of that. What would she do, if she were in Lommy's place? It must be \emph{terrible} to be like this, not being able to move at all while you felt your time running out. She remembered another boy laying without much life in him. \thought{Bran}, she thought, \thought{He's like Bran.} But Bran had Maester Luwin, and her father had said that he'd woken up again.

\thought{And Lommy doesn't have a maester. That's just not fair.}

When the others fell asleep, she stayed awake, agreeing with Gendry to again watch for soldiers coming, and to wake him up later.

So she spend hours listening to the wolves, wondering if she could make out Nymeria's voice between the others. By now, surely they must be near Castle Darry, where she'd had to chase her away?

Lommy groaned in his sleep.

She thought about what they had now. Enough food to last a fortnight, if they eat it carefully and managed to carry everything, two swords, though Gendry did not know how to use his, and if she was honest, she did not know much either. She had only practised with wooden swords in King's Landing, after all. Syrio had said they would start using Needle in Winterfell, but Ser Meryn had killed him first. Her pack consisted of a cripple who couldn't do anything, a baker's and an armourer’s apprentice who both did no how to survive on their own, a two-year-old girl and herself. \thought{We should get ourselves some horses, we would be faster with them}. Then she remembered that neither Lommy nor Weasel could ride on their own, even if they were able to find some. And while she could take Weasel on a horse together with herself, it was a different matter with Lommy. \thought{He truly wants to die}.

Next to her, he groaned again.

She remembered what Gendry had said, about what he'd do if it was him. \thought{Maybe he's right, and I'd ask the same, too, if I knew I would die anyways, sooner or later}. But should she kill him? \thought{No, that's not right, is it?} She wondered what her family would say, father and mother and Jon and Robb. Would they think her a disgusting brute? Or would they say it was right what she had done, to spare him the pain? Sansa would be terrified, of course. \thought{But she'd be just as alarmed with me killing soldiers}.

She wished for Jon or her father to be there. \thought{They'd know what to do}, she thought, but neither was here and she couldn't ask them.

\enquote{Arry}, called a low voice beside her. Lommy had woken up again, and she crawled over to him on the other side, where she could barely see the remnants of the ruin's wall. \enquote{Please, just do it. Make it end}

Should she really do it? Without him, they would be thrice as fast as with him even without horses, and their food would last longer as well. \thought{But that's no reason to kill him, she thought. If I kill him so we can be faster, I'd be no better than the criminals Yoren brought. They left us too, just to be faster.}

Quietly, she leaned over him, her sword in hand. Arya looked in his eyes, with Needle pointing at his chest. \thought{If you take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. If you cannot bear that, than perhaps the man does not deserve to die}, her father had said. She suspected it was not meant for this, but she did it all the same.

\enquote{Are you sure?}, she asked him one last time.

He nodded so slowly she could barely see it. \enquote{Yes}, he whispered, and she stabbed Needle through his heart. It was harder then anything she'd done before. Killing the stableboy had more surprised and shocked her, since she hadn't really planned that, and she hadn't known him, nor the men she'd later killed at the village to escape. But she \emph{had} known Lommy, if only briefly.

He died a moment later, with a smile on his lips.



\chapter*{Gendry}

\chbegin{T}{he days passed in silence,} and not the nice kind of it either. Hot Pie wouldn't say a word, even if asked, and Arya seemed to be brooding even more than before. She still led them, in a fashion, occasionally saying in what direction they should go, but the talkative, girl she'd been before was gone. Now it was more like when he'd first met her, when she hadn't talked at all unless spoken to first.

None of them ever said a word that wasn't necessary.

\thought{Funny, isn't it? Lommy's dead, and yet now we think more about him than before.}

He himself certainly did, and if Hot Pie's anger and fear of Arya was any indication, he was, too.

\thought{Not to mention how distant Arya has become.}

While they continued practising, and she continued to correct his mistakes when it came to hunting -- not that any of them was hunting right now, they had enough food with them for a while, even if it had started to rot a bit at the edges -- her constant teasing and not-really insulting had stopped almost entirely. Where before she'd seemed to enjoy herself teaching him, he got the impression that now it was nothing more than an unpleasant duty to her.

Even Weasel had noticed that something had changed, and while she had yet to begin her crying again, her rare attempts at playfullness had ceased.

Sometimes it seemed as if Hot Pie or even Arya wished to just stop, not caring where they were, and then to give up altogether. Gendry sometimes felt it, too.

\thought{We all knew Lommy would die}, he reminded himself, \thought{it shouldn't be so much of an issue.}

And yet it was, even to him. When he'd thought about what he would do in Lommy's place …

\thought{You didn't think about what you \emph{would} do}, he corrected himself, \thought{You knew.}

His mind was seemingly determined to always come back to that line of thought, and Gendry had to try again and again to keep himself away from it.

\thought{No good in dwelling on that.}

Instead he forced himself to go on, never to stop for a moment, and hope that the others would do the same. It was him who checked if the Kingsroad was still there every few hours, after they'd reached it, but decided it was too dangerous to use it directly. It had been Arya's idea: the road would lead them north till the Trident which they'd follow upstream to Riverrun, yet now she sometimes seemed uncaring about everything. It had been his idea to not walk on it, instead following just out of sight in the woods, so no one would ever bother them. He just had to check of it had made a sudden turning every few miles.

The silence pressed heavily on Gendry's mind, and, he suspected, on everyone else's, too.

They'd used to talk a bit before falling asleep, he remembered. Never about anything that was actually important, just little stories they'd heard. At the ruin Lommy had told them how to dye cloth. No one had really been interested in it, but it had given them a way to distract themselves from the rest of the day. That had been nice.

After days of silent travelling, Gendry decided to break it one day. It was hard, to remember how to make sentences in a way that made them stick together, and of course he'd never been much of a talker before. Still, he resolved that \emph{someone} had to do it. And while no one ever answered him, or offered a story in return, they \emph{did} listen, and while no one would ever smile, at least the frown on their faces softened a bit.

Or at least he told himself that.

So the days passed, and while their food assumed a more and more rotten form, there was something else he noticed.

Not immediately. In fact, Gendry found it very hard to lay his finger on it, and to find out what it was.

It took him almost a week.

But them he realized it: He'd stopped thinking about Arya Stark. He just thought about Arya, the girl he'd met on the road who happened to have means to keep them safe, if they made it. Who cared that she was highborn, or if they could stay together once there? No matter what, it would always be better than dying.

Though he \emph{did} care about the fact that she never uttered a word unless she couldn't avoid it. So he continued to tell her stories before she fell asleep, and sometimes long after that. He told her what he remembered about his mother, the yellow hair and the kind songs. He even tried to sing one, once, but found that a happy song only worsened the mood.

So instead, he told her about life in King's Landing, about life on the streets after his mother had died, told her everything he'd done to survive. All the stealing, all the cowardly running away.

He wasn't quite sure if she even listened, but found he didn't care. Once he'd started, it was surprisingly difficult to stop again, so he just went on and on, telling her about his life at the forge, about Master Mott, about the swords he'd made and how he'd got the idea for the Bull's head helmet that they now used as a basket for slowly-rotting meat that was still better than hunger.

Sometimes she almost, but not quite, smiled at him.

His hopes that it might be the same with Hot Pie were shattered, though. After the first few days he stopped listening entirely and fell asleep whenever Gendry raised his voice.

Still, he refused to stop. He'd made his helmet in the likeness of a bull after people had said he was stubborn; he wouldn't give up now. He would not.

They'd reach Riverrun, they \emph{would}.

And until then, even if no one else ever spoke, he would continue to not accept the silence. He'd just tell stories against it, and hope that someone else someday would, too.

Except that most of time it seemed as if the only ones who'd willingly say anything to him were wolves. Every night they howled, and every night Gendry hoped that they wouldn't find them. While he generally \emph{was} thankful for the trees around them that kept them hidden from any traveller on the Kingsroad, he could have done without the wolves they held.

Curiously, Arya seemed to disagree. She never said so, of course,  but she'd taken more and more to listening to them whenever he wasn't talking, or so it seemed.

Or maybe that was just something his mind made up since there wasn't much else to see while the days passed in silence and the nights with howling wolves, both equally depressing and making his feeble attempts at breaking them seem completely irrelevant.

Until one day they weren't.

He hadn't expected that. He hadn't even planned that. After a while, it had all become sort of a ritual for them: in the evenings, Gendry would tell a story, Hot Pie and Weasel would fall asleep without uttering a word, and sometimes Arya would listen. Every time, he also wondered if he should tell her of her father, of how he'd met him. In the end, he always resolved not to. Arya was so quiet, whether because of guilt or grief over Lommy's death he could not know; but he was sure that him reminding her of her father would only make it worse.

But then one day she broke the silence, and offered him a story back. He'd told her of Erryk again, who'd been another of Master Mott's apprentices and something of a friend to him, while most others  had shunned him for being even lower born than they were themselves, that it was him who'd first called him a \enquote{stubborn bull}. And then, suddenly, when he had long finished and was half asleep himself, she started talking.

\enquote{You know, Jon and I used to spend hours in the broken tower whenever it was stormy outside, so we couldn't be in the Godswood.}, she began, her voice low, but determined, \enquote{It's just an old ruin, really, but Old Nan used to say that it had been the tallest tower of Winterfell, once. When you are in the lowest level, not too high, it wasn't to windy inside, and not too cold, but the ground is covered in dirt. That's why we came there, we could draw things in the dirt. That was easier than getting paper from Maester Luwin, since no one ever asked us what we were doing, that way. We'd draw maps there, or, well, Jon would, he was much better at it.}

Gendry listened, almost rejoicing that he'd finally succeeded. He only understood half of what she said, but that was already more than enough.

\enquote{We brought stones with us and placed them on it. Then we'd pretend that we were Kings, and the stones were our armies, and we'd try to conquer the other's land. Just that. Us, sitting there, arguing which stone would win every time two of them met.}

Her face had a far-away looking expression on it, and just the barest hint of a smile.

\enquote{It was so easy, then. We'd fight our little wars, and when one of us won, we'd just leave again. Most times, mother would scold me for being dirty again, but she always did that, and I'd never cared anyways. Then next time, we'd draw a different map, or maybe the same, and start again. Sometimes someone else would win then, though not often. Normally Jon always won, but that doesn't mean I never did.}

Gendry didn't dare to interrupt her, but when she went on to tell him about how her brother had giver her the sword she still used, and how he'd named it and why, and told him about her sister, about how her older brothers had once tried to scare her in Winterfell's crypts and how she'd seen right though it, and went on and on until it seemed that she wouldn't ever stop again, he allowed himself to feel a spark of hope again.

\chbegin{A}{rya wondered how wet she could possibly get.} It had been pouring down for days now, and long since they'd all started to cough. \emph{Everything} was wet, even the meat they caught, or whatever fruits and berries they found, not to mention the ground and the road.

When they'd finally reached the Trident and started to look for the River Road that would take them to Riverrun, the road itself might as well have been a small river in its own right, and they'd had a hard time at recognizing it.

Though that might also be because of something else. Neither Hot Pie nor Gendry had ever seen it before, after all, so it was again left to her to decide where to go. Only, near the Trident was Castle Darry. And near Castle Darry Arya found that she couldn't think straight.

She tried to remember where the road was.

\thought{It can't be this hard, father showed me - \emph{us} - pointed it out to us.}

But somehow, it was. She'd been with Sansa then, and with Father, and had refused to say a single word to either of them, having been to busy seething about the Queen wanting to kill Nymeria, and the injustice of it all.

\thought{Joffrey was it who attacked me, and Mycah too! \emph{He}'s the one who should be punished, not me or Nymeria, she was just defending me.}

She knew she shouldn't think about Mycah now, that would only distract her, but she could not help it. \thought{Why did he have to die?}

If this crossroads had been cursed, it could not have been a greater distraction to her.

\thought{Maybe it is cursed}, she thought, \thought{every time I'm here, I start to think about Nymeria and Mycah.}

Only last time, her father had been with her. He'd stood right beside her, in fact, and pointed down the road.

\enquote{Ride this way for a week and you're at Riverrun, your mother's home}, he'd said, to her and Sansa.

\thought{Sansa}, Arya remembered, \thought{she was here, too}. That had probably been the point, she realized now: Her father wanted them to talk to each other again, so he'd taken them both here, to show them where their mother had once lived.

It hadn't worked, of course. Sansa's wolf had just been killed, and she'd blamed it on Arya, and Arya herself had just learned that Mycah, the butcher's son, had himself ended as a butcher's work, and blamed it on Sansa, who wouldn't say anything against her valiant Joffrey.

So neither of them had uttered a word, both lost in their own thoughts of guilt, blaming each other.

Yet now Arya desperately wished she'd talked to Sansa, if only to have a happier memory of that day.

Then she might be more certain that this streak of mud she saw now really was the road they searched for.

\enquote{Arry}, someone ripped her from her rambling thoughts.

\thought{Gendry}, she realized, then, \thought{he's practising swords with me, too.} For a brief moment, she wondered what she'd do if he'd end like Mycah.

\thought{No, that won't happen. I won't let them, and Joffrey and the Queen aren't here now, anyways.}

\enquote{Arry, you've got any ideas? These roads look all the same to me. Oh, and I'm bloody cold and really don't want to stay in this mud any longer, and I don't think you should either. You don't even have shoes.}

That was true, she realized, she'd left them behind at the God's Eye. Well, she'd manage., although it \emph{would} be more comfortable to hide beneath the trees again. Turning round, she saw that Hot Pie and Weasel hadn't even left them, and were still hidden.

\thought{It does look like it might be the right one}, she thought. The last time they'd spotted the sun was ages ago, but if memory served right then it lead west, and even with the heavy rain she didn't think that any other stream would swell to the size of the one a little further north. But even so, if she was wrong …

\enquote{This road}, Arya said, \enquote{It'll lead us to Riverrun.}

\thought{Or at least in the right direction.} They'd walk a bit north of it, anyways, again to avoid the road, but this time also to avoid the mud. If it wasn't the right one, they could always follow the Trident itself. Arya didn't really remember if Riverrun was north or south of it, but it certainly was \emph{near }it.

So they continued their walk, in the woods north of this road. Thankfully, the trees' roots prevented the ground from becoming as slick as the open road, and sometimes gave a bit of shelter. That didn't exactly mean they stayed \emph{dry}, but still. It was a start, Arya supposed.

And continued to hope they'd find enough food. What they'd found at the village wouldn't last forever, they'd always known that, but now was dwindling almost alarmingly fast, while the road didn't seem to have an end. When she'd travelled south from Winterfell with her father, Arya had never realized quite how \emph{vast} the land here was. After Castle Darry everything had been something of a blur, and next thing she remembered shed been in King's Landing feeling miserably hot. But even before that, she'd always spent ages just running around, exploring and making friends, without really paying attention to where they were going or how far.

She remembered that once she'd brought her father flowers, and that later it had turned out they were slightly poisonous, and no one but Sansa had really cared about it. But if she'd do something similar now …

\thought{No, you can't think of that, not now.}

Now they walked all the time, through wet-dripping woods that never really seemed to change, and spent their nights hidden beneath whatever large tree or rock they could find. That way, at least they wouldn't drown in mud.

Arya wished she'd knew more about the crannogmen, who spend all their lives in something that was even \emph{worse.} Travelling through the neck, it had seemed exciting, if a little odd that you could actually \emph{live} there, but now Arya came to truly admire and respect these people. Of course, she didn't know a thing about live in the swamps of the neck. She'd been to busy reading about wildlings and warrior queens whenever she'd been in the library.

\thought{And now I know to run away from a shadowcat if I ever spot one, but not how to hunt in a swamp without getting stuck, or what kind of berries I can eat and still wake up come morning. What use is that?}

For some reason, though, it seemed as if the others had come to expect she'd know what to do.

Well, Gendry, a bit. She didn't know about Hot Pie, but then, she didn't really know \emph{anything} about Hot Pie. He hadn't talked to her ever since the village, after all.

\thought{Ever since I killed Lommy}, she corrected herself.

She was still wondering if it had been the right choice, still wished that Jon or her father had been there to help. Or Maester Luwin, that would've been even better.

Yet they hadn't been, and the only one who'd even talk to her now was Gendry.

Actually, now that she thought about it, they talked rather a lot. Mostly at night, when Hot Pie was already asleep, trading stories. When he'd first started it had irritated her to no end, yet after she'd told him of how she and Jon had used to play in the broken tower, she found she couldn't stop.

So every night they talked and talked and talked. She knew of how Gendry had lived in the streets of King's Landing ever since his mother had died, knew how he'd come to be called \emph{the Bull.} He knew of Winterfell, of Jon, of little Bran who'd used to climb all over the castle, had sometimes found Jon and her in the broken tower playing and had asked whether he could join in. He knew of father and Ice, even of Syrio and of how Jon had given her Needle.

She hadn't expected it, but Arya found that sharing all this with someone else made it easier to think about it, easier to remember home without feeling as hopeless about it as she'd felt before.

And whenever they'd finished telling stories and fell asleep, she dreamt of wolves. It was raining in her dreams, too, which her night-self found incredibly irritating, but still the stayed where she was, with her little cousins all around her. Sometimes she thought she'd caught a glimpse of a few humans lying on the ground while she was asleep, and sometimes she thought she'd caught a glimpse of a few wolves behind the trees when she was awake.

And then she woke up again, every time, with the nice dream only a fading memory, and had to face \emph{another} bleak and depressing day, with Hot Pie's silence and Weasels wailing.

The girl actually didn't cry very much anymore, now that she thought of it, but that didn't mean it was any easier with her. She was only two, after all, and had even more trouble walking in the sticky wet dirt that they had. Mostly, Hot Pie would carry her, but never for too long. Arya didn't ask why. He wouldn't answer, anyways, and it was plain to see for everyone. They'd all got thinner since they'd started, even she herself who'd been skinny to begin with, but it was the worst for Hot Pie. In King's Landing he'd been a fat young boy, yet by now he must have lost half his weight, and he always was so \emph{pale.}

So after a few hours Arya would carry her instead. They never talked about it, as much as they never talked about anything else, but after the first few days they'd all come to something of a silent understanding. Gendry carried the food they still had from the fields of the ruined village while Arya and Hot Pie took turns with Weasel.

And still, the road just \emph{refused to end}. Arya could have cursed it, called to all the Gods she knew to just \emph{let the road end}, but ever since the crossroads she'd started to think more and more of Sansa again, and how she'd never do that.

\thought{Just for Sansa}, she told herself, she'd try.

That night she dreamt of the wolves again, after sharing stories with Gendry and listening to his in turn. She could always hear them while they talked, could always hear the comforting howling that she'd become so familiar with while Nymeria had still been with her.

Sometimes, whenever they didn't talk, she'd listen to them, and wondered if one of them might be her. It had been at Castle Darry that she'd had to chase her away; was it so unreasonable to think that she might still be here?

\thought{But that's stupid}, she told herself, \thought{Why would Nymeria stay here? Everything's cold and wet, and there isn't too much to be found in the woods.} That had been a bitter lesson, she remembered, to learn just how hard it was to catch anything between these trees.

No, Nymeria wasn't here, of course not.

So instead, Arya dreamt of wolves. She always was one of them herself at night, the largest and most fearsome there ever was. Running, always running, running on muddy ground beneath plants that did little to stop the rain pouring down on her back. So many of her cousins had only reluctantly followed her, and some of them not at all.

But her goal was here, her charge, her \emph{human}. Somewhere, between these trees. Behind them. Hidden. But \emph{close}, so close, and once she found the human, she wouldn't let go again, she promised herself that.

She would \emph{not} fail her again.

She would not desert her, not leave her with another vile monster whose evil reeking filled her snout from half a day's run away.

She would \emph{not}.

So she ran. Searching, always searching. She could feel her already, just a little further, behind that tree, across this little bush of undergrowth, across this muddy track that still smelled inexplicably \emph{right} and familiar to her, and …

\thought{There.}

Beneath a particularly tall-grown tree there was a man and a boy, and a pup, and - 

Suddenly her view became all shaky and twisted, and Arya found herself ripped from sleep.

\thought{Not now, please, just a little longer, I was almost there - }

Then Gendry's face appeared above her, filled with panic.

\enquote{\emph{Arry!}}, he shouted, \enquote{wake up, Arry, we have to go, wake the others, there's a giant wolf behind that bush there, I've seen it - }

Of all his shouting, only one word made its way into Arya's mind.

\thought{Wolf.} He'd said \thought{giant wolf.}

Standing up, her sleepiness was all but forgotten, but not out of fear. For behind the growth, where Gendry'd pointed, there was - just barely visible - a shape so familiar it almost hurt to see it again.

\thought{It can't be}, she told herself, \thought{it was just a dream - }

Yet there she was, to Arya's joy.

\enquote{Nymeria!}, she cried out, and the shape left its hiding behind. Arya brushed Gendry's arms off herself and ran towards her direwolf.

Throwing her arms around Nymeria's head, she cried tears of joy, and hugged her again as hard as she'd done only once before, when she'd had to …

\enquote{Nymeria, I'm sorry,} she whispered, \enquote{I'm so sorry, but I had to - they would have killed you if I hadn't}

And for a moment, Arya had the odd feeling that the wolf understood her, and then that she had \thought{answered}, not just by pressing closer, but by - 

\thought{No, don't be stupid, wolves can't speak, no matter if direwolf or not.}

But she didn't really care, and just remained there for a moment longer, not noticing that Nymeria was even wetter than she was herself, that she was now \emph{soaked}, even more so than before … Arya didn't care about that.

After a while, when she let go and turned around, Arya had to fight herself to not burst out laughing.

Gendry stood there, just a few feet away from her, and his face couldn't have looked more confused and afraid even if he'd just witnessed her hugging one of the Others out of Old Nan's stories.

\enquote{Arya?}, he asked her in a voice that sounded like he wouldn't be surprised at all if a dragon chose this moment to fly over them, \enquote{what …}

\enquote{I told you of Nymeria, didn't I?}, she said, still holding back laughter.

\enquote{You've grown quite a bit, you know? Last time I saw you, you were the size of a kennel-dog.}

It was true; While she wasn't exactly the size of a pony, which according to Maester Luwin she'd reach easily when fully grown, Nymeria was now tall enough for her to hug without bending down.

The rest of the night Arya spent lying next to Nymeria, whose fur was, despite it dripping water all the time, surprisingly warm. When Arya woke up, the first thing she noticed was her as well. Her wolf. 
\thought{Must look quite strange, me lying beside a giant wolf the size of a young pony.} She laughed when she imagined what Yoren might think of that. He’d only ever known her to be frightened of the wolves at night. Not as greeting them as old friends.

\chapter*{Gendry}

\chbegin{T}{he Inn was beside the river.} A simple two-story house, with a lower one made of grey stones, an upper one of wood and a steep thatched roof, still wet from heavy rain. Somehow, it looked peacefully. It was certainly the most remarkable and beautiful thing Gendry had seen since King's Landing except maybe their meal at the ruined village. There was, of course, absolutely nothing special about it. \thought{Well, nothing special save the fact that it's not burned to the ground. That's good}, Gendry supposed, \thought{Might mean there's less fighting round here.} That would be the first good news since Yoren's death. \thought{And maybe we'll be faster as well.} He supposed that was good as well, but every time he thought about it, he felt more nervous about it. The moment they'd reach Riverrun. \thought{No matter what Arya said, they'd be more like to turn me away or even torture me a bit to find out what I've done to her.} That's how it always was with highborns. They always caused trouble, and then blamed it all on people like him. \thought{Except Arya.} But of course it was her uncle commanding Riverrun, and it seemed less than likely to Gendry that he'd be the same.

\thought{Stop thinking about that. For now, you don't even know whether or not you'll ever see it. Just look at that inn.}

Above its door was a painting of a man on his knees, bowing to some other man. Below it, the wooden door stood open. When they entered, a man at the other end of the room looked up.

\enquote{Ah, welcome, you lot, to the Inn of the Kneeling Man! Good to see anyone, it's quite hard to live as innkeep without guests.}

\thought{That won't change today}, he thought, \thought{we don't have any money.} He still had the bit of molten copper from the ruin, but he doubted they would get \emph{food} for it. Beside him, Arya seemed to think the same. They didn't have anything. Neither of them had really wanted to go inside in the first place. It was Hot Pie who'd dragged them both in, though he didn't seem to have any ideas on what to do now, either. Gendry suspected that he just wanted a few moments inside a proper house, even if they'd be thrown out not long after. Not that he couldn't understand that, he'd felt the same from the moment he'd set eyes on the building.

Still, the fact remained. They didn't have any money, and Gendry wasn't na\"ive enough to hope the inn's keep would give them even a loaf of bread for free.

\thought{Well, we've got nothing except what that monster keeps bringing her.} No matter what Arya said, for Gendry a wolf almost the size of a small horse would always be monstrous. But accepting a giant wolf stalking them and keeping them fed was not really the hard part for him. The hardest part had been Hot Pie. He had never been exceptionally brave when something looked dangerous, which Nymeria surely did. When he'd first spotted the wolf that morning - thank the seven he hadn't woken \emph{him} up first that night - , he'd run away, and it had taken them halfway to midday to find him again, and then another couple of hours to convince him everything was perfectly well. Even after that he shuddered every time he saw the wolf or Arya. And Gendry couldn't exactly \emph{fault} him for it, either. The beast was certainly a frightening sight, and even he himself had trouble accepting it. After learning of Arry's true name and place he hadn't thought that anything could shock him that much anymore, and yet the thought of a direwolf named  for some ancient queen most certainly had done exactly that. Only after Arya sent her away to hunt and be with her pack it had gotten a little better, but Hot Pie still stayed as far away from the both of them as he could. And with him, of course, Weasel. He had not thought that someone like Hot Pie could care for a small child, but oddly, he did. \thought{Probably just because he hasn't got any other options. Arya scares him and I'm her friend, however much I'm mystified by that.} Maybe he should talk more with him, but every time he tried he'd think of how he had treated Arya back with Yoren. \thought{When did I start to feel protective of her?}, he wondered. Was this how one might think of a friend, or maybe a sister? He could not know. He had never had either of them before.

He looked at Arya. \thought{Seven Hells, every time I got a problem now I look at her and expect her to solve it.} He wondered when that had started, too. \thought{Though it works surprisingly well, most of the time.} And it did again, this time.

\enquote{We don't have money}, she said, after chewing her lip, \enquote{But we've got meat aplenty. You'll get half of it if you cook it for us. You agree?}

It was true, Gendry had a huge bloody chunk of it in his hand. He didn't exactly know what it was, but it wasn't as if he cared.

The man considered her for a moment.

\enquote{I think I will. With all this war and outlaws 'round here, you never know when you'll get something. Half the peasants have fled to Riverrun, and the other half's either dead or hiding in caves. What do you have?}

They showed him a rabbit Arya had caught, a squirrel Gendry had and half a deer. Or at least Arya said it was a deer. Gendry couldn't be too sure, but then again, he'd never been outside a city before. Nymeria had killed it and eaten the other half, but there was still much left of it. The innkeep seemed surprised, but did not ask them how they had come by it. \thought{Probably thinking we just found it in some abandoned camp.} Instead, he gave it to his wife, who'd appeared from the door behind him, taking it with her to what Gendry supposed must be the kitchen. Hot Pie followed her, probably looking if he was able to help with anything, or just happy that he'd come across something familiar. It didn't take long till everything smelled of roasted meat. That was all it took for Gendry's stomach to ache. \thought{I've had enough raw meat, time I get something warm again.} He knew he probably should not complain. He had likely eaten more meat in the last fortnight then in his whole life. Still, there was quite a difference between raw squirrel and cooked deer. He tried to remember if he'd ever eaten deer before.

While the innkeep's wife and Hot Pie made the food ready to eat, the three of them sat down on the nearest table. A nice table of wood, of which he could not say, dark and a bit old and not exactly flat, but all of them, even Weasel, stared at it as if it was made of solid gold. After pouring them some ale, the innkeep joined them.

\thought{Ale}, Gendry thought, \thought{real ale.} He drank deep. \thought{Must be the best ale in the world}, he thought.

\enquote{You know anything about the war?}, Arya asked him.

\enquote{Not much. Few days ago, some Lannister envoy stayed here for a night. Said he was on his way to Riverrun, he did, delivering terms or somesuch, but all I could get from him was that they hadn't met the young wolf's terms. Didn't ask him any further, was busy enough trying to feed at least some of his men, he must've had more then a hundred of them, judging by how much they drank.}

\enquote{A Lannister envoy?}

\enquote{Aye, all with an endless tail of guards and more horses than any sensible man could ever have any use for. He'd been here before, too, only on his way south, though he'd had less men back then. Then, I could feed them. This time I barely had enough for the lot of them to drink. And they liked my ale, that they did. They all do.}

\enquote{So they're making peace now?}, Gendry asked him.

\enquote{Would be surprised if they managed it. It's the same in every war. They all pass through here, but there's never any peace coming from it. And believe me, lads, I've seen enough envoys in my life to've learnt that by now. Wars end with one side dead, like with King Aerys, not with all of them envoys. Especially not now, what with both sides havin' kings.}

\enquote{Both sides have kings?}

\enquote{Aye, they have. More than that, even. There's King Joffrey, the son-or-not o' good old King Robert. Then there's his uncle Renly, who's declared himself king as well. That much I knew when it all started. Then that envoy I told you of came through for the first time and told me there's a northern King now too, which got me thinkin' whether I should change that paintin' o' the wall there, and then he came through a second time and told me all o' King's Landing shivered from fear o' some other King I can't even remember. Was named Stannis or some such. Most like, he'll come through a third time and tell me of another one.}

\enquote{There's a northern king?}, Arya asked him, like she did not quite believe him. Only then did he notice what that might mean. It had been so \emph{easy} to forget all this on the road.

\enquote{Aye, some Stark King. King o' the north or something the like. The one whose father's head was chopped of. Can't remember why. Robb, I think his name was, for old King Robert. If he's half as drunk he might even win, and then I'll be making a fortune just on that. Might die as a wealthy man, I'd like that. Don't think he will, though. Looks too much like the tragic hero, avenging his father. Rhaegar once did that, too, and then Robert, and look what happened to them.}

\enquote{King Robert won}, he could not help but point out.

\enquote{And? Might be he won, but that girl he went to war for died. Doesn't look too happy to me. No, it's more like he dies, and than the rest will die as well. Mark my words, boys, in a war with two sides one dies, and in one with more than two, it's lucky when someone survives at all. Last time there'd been more than one King, it only ever ended when Ser Barristan killed the last of the Blackfyres, not with them \emph{talking}. By the way, you know what happened to him? Thought he might've shown up by now, too. Would have been nice. Last time he was here I missed him, had been out for the day, seeing if there was any meat to come by somewhere. That was just after the Trident, and then I came home to my wife saying Barristan the Bold had been here. Hoped I might get a second chance on that one, you think I will?}

He thought he might let Arya answer this one; she was the highborn, after all, and probably knew more than he did. Yet when he looked at her he saw her face betraying anger if he had ever seen it. \thought{He just said her brother will die}, he realized, and wondered how he would feel about that, if he had one. \thought{I should say something, before she stabs him.}

\enquote{Word in King's Landing was that King Joffrey had thrown him out, for letting his father die. Don't think he'll be coming through anytime soon. Anyways, how do you live, with all the fighting round here?}, Gendry asked the man.

\enquote{Ah, I'll live on, without a king. They have never done me any good with all their fighting. But the envoys, I like them. They might not bring peace, but they do have good coin. That's what I need to live, not \emph{kings}.} He spat on the ground, then laughed as if he had made some funny joke. \enquote{What'll become o' me? I'll stay here, what else? Maybe the envoy comes a third time, and I'll live on his money a little longer.}

\enquote{You don't want to go, then?}, Arya asked him, her voice surprisingly calm, \enquote{Not afraid they'll burn your inn down, like they did with all the others?}

\enquote{Nah. Listen, boy, I've stayed here my entire life. Even when King Robert fought dragons and all the lands 'round here were burning even more than they're now. I'll not go now. I've never left this place, and if that's the reason I die, so be it!} He laughed again, and drank his ale.

Gendry drank, too, and when he looked beside him, Arya did too. Weasel was sitting on her lap, and she tried to get her drink it. Weasel's face became a warped expression of dislike, and she spit it out again all over Arya's legs. Gendry couldn't help but laugh, and soon Arya herself joined in as well. Still, she looked as if she was not quite there at all, and her laugh never reached her eyes. Gendry could not fault her. \thought{Her brother's a king, and the man who told her of it believes he'll die.} Then another thought occurred to him. \thought{If her brother's a king, does that makes her a princess?} He wondered if she would like being one. She said she was no lady, and most times he believed her, but a \emph{princess}? That made her even higher, and him even more below her.

\thought{She certainly doesn't have the look of one, or the manners. Especially the manners.} In fact, he noticed there was less ale left in her cup than in his own.

\enquote{Aren't you a bit young for drinking that fast?}, he asked her, \enquote{And used to finer stuff as well?}

He liked to tease her, to make her call him or her high birth stupid. That especially. She did not disappoint him.

\enquote{Shut up, stupid! I just like the way it tastes, much better than the dirty water we've had to drink. And my stupid sister is the one for wine, not me.}

\thought{That's how I like her. All dirty and insulting and on her way getting as drunk as the king.}

\enquote{How far is it to Riverrun?}, she asked the innkeep now.

\enquote{Two or three days on a horse. But I wouldn't go there. Lord Tully might let you in, but it seems to me the castle is under siege now more often than not. You don't want to be in a castle under siege, do you?}

\enquote{Riverrun's under siege?}

\enquote{Did I say that? It was besieged not long ago, aye, and like as not it'll be again soon enough.}

\enquote{But it's not now?}

\enquote{Not that I know of.}

\enquote{How long will it take to reach it on foot?}

\enquote{Longer than three days, I'd think.} When she looked confused by that, he added \enquote{Never been there. And I don't ask the men coming through here too much, they don't like that. No point in having a fine inn if nobody likes it.}

His wife called something from the the other room, and he left them there.

\enquote{I'll bring you your meat}, he said

\enquote{Gendry?}, Arya asked him once the man was gone, \enquote{Do you think he has a horse?}

There had been a stable outside, he recalled, and he \emph{had} heard horses inside. \enquote{I'd think so}

\enquote{You think we could get one?}

\enquote{And how would you want to do that?} \thought{Don't tell me you want to steal it}, he pleaded, \thought{I could not steal a thing if my life depended one it}. He tried to tell himself not to be stupid, that he wasn't that young boy in King's Landing anymore. It did not work. \thought{If I ever see you again, they'll find you in Flea Bottom, in the meat shops!}, the shouting still echoed in his head, \thought{Or might be I'll be giving you to the goldcloaks, and they'll put you in one of these black cells!}

\enquote{We'd give him more meat}, Arya suggested.

\enquote{And why would he agree to that?}

\enquote{He just said that he won't go anywhere, and that it was hard to get anything these days. So why should he need a horse?}

Gendry heard a door opening; the innkeep was coming back, helping Hot Pie with plates of wonderfully smelling cooked meat. The boy seemed the happiest that Gendry had ever seen him.

\enquote{Leave that to me}, he told Arya, enjoying the expression of surprise on her face. Gendry normally wasn't one to talk very much, but if he'd learned anything about people from Master Mott, it was how to haggle with them. Mott had been a master in it.

It was hard to concentrate on it while all he wanted was to wolf his meat down, but he managed it in the end, pointing out how the innkeep would not need horses since he was not going anywhere, that he had to feed the horses, that they would become thinner and thinner over time. Most like, he said, with the rains here they'd get stuck anyways, and if he ever tried to they'd probably no use at all. It helped that unlike the man, he had not drunken much ale, though he desperately hoped that not everything he told him was right or they'd be of no use to them, either.

In the end, he got them a room for the night and a promise of a horse for a quarter of its weight in meat. He hoped Nymeria could hunt fast enough. \thought{Don't be stupid, if the wolf can kill several deer per day, you've got nothing to worry about.}

When they'd finished eating it was just past noon, and they'd have time to get more than enough meat. She and Gendry went outside again, though she told him he was not needed.

\enquote{You make too much noise, stupid}, she complained, \enquote{If you'd be as quiet as a shadow, I wouldn't say anything. But you'll just scare everything of.}

Then they were inside the woods again, well hidden from view. He always liked being alone with Arya. He was the only one who knew her secret, and it made him feel special for the first time in his life. Especially now, when that secret had grown even bigger.

\enquote{Apologies, princess.}

Arya stopped dead on her feet.

\enquote{\emph{What did you say?}}

The sight of her would have been enough to make most people back down, but he wasn't called \emph{the Bull} for nothing.

\enquote{Well if your brother's a king, you're a princess, aren't you?} He tried to make it sound as if it was not big deal to him, thought he doubted he'd succeeded. He was a smith, after all, and not an actor.

\enquote{Oh}, she said, like she had not even considered that, \enquote{I - err - I'm not - I mean - I can't be - }

\enquote{A princess?}, he suggested, and she nodded.

\enquote{What use am I as a princess?}

Gendry considered a moment, then said, \enquote{You know, I've never heard of a fighting lady before, but there's plenty of tales about warrior princesses.}

\enquote{That's stupid, that's just \emph{stories}!}, she told him, yet he could see that it \emph{did} cheer her up a bit.

\enquote{Of course, princess.}

\enquote{\emph{Stop} that!}

\enquote{Why? You only said not to call you m'lady. There was never any talk about calling you princess.}

She gave something of a furious outcry, then turned and left him behind.

\enquote{Hey, wait Arya!}, he called after her, \enquote{Right, fine, I'll stop calling you that.}

She did not seem to care. Gendry sighed and followed her.

\enquote{Arya! Where're you going?}

\enquote{To find meat.}

\enquote{You really think that's a good idea? To get us horses? You know you're the only one who's ever sit on one, Arya?}, he asked her, and finally she stopped and turned back to him.

\thought{As long as you don't talk about her being highborn, she could be just another child. Well, no ordinary child, but still.}

\enquote{So? Maybe it's time to change that?}

\enquote{And then? We'll get one horse, two at most, and that's still one two few.}

\enquote{I could ride with you, teaching you how to do it. And if that doesn't work …}, she got closer to him \enquote{I still have Nymeria.}

\enquote{Nymeria?}, he said, surprised and a little frightened, \enquote{You can ride on \emph{her?}}, he asked her, looking at the huge wolf who'd just appeared between the trees. No that he thought of it, she was not \emph{that} mush smaller than a pony. \thought{A very, very fast pony.} Gendry did not doubt the direwolf could outrun every horse, even the lordly ones that cost what he'd earn in his entire life.

\enquote{It was hard when I first tried it, since she's not a horse. She normally doesn't like having someone on her back. But when she accepts it, it's no harder than riding a horse. Easier, even. She understands me much better than a horse could.}

\thought{That's true}, he supposed. He had noticed the strange understanding between them. Arya could say something to the wolf and she would respond accordingly, not like a dog who'd been trained to react to certain words but more as if she truly understood what Arya said. And it was the same the other way round, too, as Arya always seemed to know what Nymeria was trying to say. It frightened him a bit, but then again, this was \emph{Arya}. He somehow thought he shouldn't be so surprised to learn she had kept a giant wolf as a pet.

That didn't stop him from being nervous, though. While it had been \emph{days} since he'd first seen her he still had to suppress his fear every time he saw her. She just looked too monstrous, with these golden eyes that seemed to pierce right into his soul.

He left the wolf-handling to Arya. He wondered how she did it, but it did not take her more time than she might need to say \emph{We need meat to buy a horse, can you get it for us?}, and Nymeria was on her way, soon disappeared into the forest, and the two of them were alone. Only then did he start to wonder what they'd do all the time.

Obviously Arya had something in mind, judging by the way she held her sword.

\enquote{You'd like to practice a bit?}

He thought he probably shouldn't be so happy when a highborn offered to spar with him. Sparring with highborns was seldom safe or without consequences, but every time she actually \emph{asked} him, he could not help himself.

It was not long before she had her sword at his throat, something that still bugged him every time that happened. But he wasn't \emph{completely} useless, and their second fight ended with Arya pinned to the ground, both her tiny wrists in one of his hands.

\enquote{You're cheating!}, she accused him, \enquote{You're supposed to fight with your sword, not holding me down like this.}

Gendry could not help but laugh and wonder who else would say he cheated while in this situation. \thought{Well, certainly not Hot Pie.} The boy had not said much to any of them in the past few days, but right now Gendry did not care about him at all.

He held his sword at her throat, careful not to cut herself.

\enquote{You're dead Arya}, he said, \enquote{Happy now?}

\enquote{At least you've got the sword there. Right, fine, I'm dead. Now, can we start over or do you want to pin me down like this all day?}

He chuckled, let her go and charged again.

By the time Nymeria returned to them, they were both exhausted, even dirtier than they'd been before, and Gendry thought he had a scratch somewhere at his neck. \thought{Fuck. We should have used sticks again.} Arya always insisted they use their real swords to make it feel more accurate, but he only worried about hurting her. Though he did not suppose Arya was as afraid of drawing blood as he was, not even if it was her own.

He had her almost on the ground again when he was thrown right off her and found himself looking into a pair of golden eyes and a monstrous mouth still dripping with blood.

\enquote{Get off him, Nymeria! You're a wolf, you \emph{can't} spar with men!}

He had never been so thankful to hear her voice, or to feel her wolf responding to it.

Nymeria got off him.

\enquote{Silly wolf}, Arya said, \enquote{men don't like to play with wolves. They never have a chance.}

Nymeria looked at her as id she wasn't really happy with that.

Gendry hoped Nymeria had really only wanted to play with them. \thought{And not to rip my throat for leaving her mistress with a scratch.} The thought reminded him of what her family might say when they reached that. If anything, he felt even more dread at the prospect.

\enquote{Are you going to stare into the woods all day?}, Arya ranted at him, \enquote{Can't you help me with this?}

Turning around, he saw that Arya was struggling to cut something like a deer in two with that little Needle of hers. He wasn't exactly an expert on knives - that had been Erryk's job, back at the forge - but even he knew that it was more like she broke the blade than the meat.

He let her try a bit more, until she looked at him rather accusatory, then went over to her and just cut it in half.

Arya did nothing for a moment, then shrugged, and said something like \enquote{only because you're stronger than me.}

They hid the meat beneath a hedge and trusted Nymeria to not eat it during the night. It would be better if they'd show him all together tomorrow, he'd told her, so the innkeep would be more surprised and impressed about how much it really was.

They spent the rest of the day outside, cutting and hiding whatever bits of meat the wolves got them, and sparring when there was nothing to do. Most times, Arya was still to fast for him.

They had a \emph{lot} of meat, more than they could ever hope to use or even take with them, and Gendry wondered where exactly the wolves had caught all this. He also wondered what the innkeep would think when he saw this. \thought{That one of use is some kind of sorcerer, probably.}

Worse, Gendry wasn't even sure if Arya was not, with the way she communicated with that beast.

\thought{It doesn't matter. She'll be at Riverrun in a few day's time.} He was not so sure about himself. It had been so easy to forget all this in the wild. That Arya \emph{was} highborn, no matter how she behaved. Should he go with her? He would be back at serving someone he hardly knew, then. And while Gendry \emph{was} longing to be in a forge again, he was not so sure about serving. \thought{Would it be any different there than in King's Landing?} He had been surprised and a bit shocked about joining the Night's Watch, yet when he had gotten used to the idea, he thought it would not be so bad. \thought{It's a brotherhood. There's still some lord commanding, but at least they are brothers, and they choose the commander, too.} He wondered what that would be like, to have a brother. Like it was with Arya, protecting one another?

What \emph{would} happen if he went with Arya? Would they even still be friends? He'd told her they could not be friends, had wanted to warn her they might have to part. \thought{You'd think I'd forget you? Then you're stupid.} But what if she truly wouldn't forget him? Gendry couldn't really imagine her lordly family would be fine with them being friends.

\thought{They'd hate her for being friends with me, and me for accepting it.} No, he thought, he had to leave before they reached Riverrun. Then … maybe he could still go to the Wall. The idea pained him more than he had expected. He did not want to part from her.

Gendry sighed, and followed Arya back inside.

The room the meat had bought them had only two beds. Given that they slept near each other every night, it really shouldn't be a problem, but still. He had just thought about what Arya's family would say to him, and somehow he thought it would be bad if they learned they'd shared a bed. Not that Arya saw any problem there, of course. She just laid herself beside him, and there was nothing he could've said without making Hot Pie more suspicious than he already was.

\thought{You should enjoy being near her}, he told himself, \thought{talking to her, laying beside her, even just looking at her.} He wouldn't have any opportunity for that much longer. \thought{I'm going to miss her}, he realised, \thought{badly. The only highborn who ever cared for me.} If anyone had told him he would have a highborn girl protecting and teaching him how to survive a year ago, he would've laughed right in their faces. \thought{No one cares for me. I'm just a bastard. Another no one, like a thousand others even if I should become the best blacksmith in the world.} A year ago, he'd hated that, yet now he sometimes found himself wishing back, in a time before everything had become so complicated. Though he didn't really want to not be friends with Arya, either.

But he could not be her friend. He \emph{must not} be her friend. Not even if she wanted him to. No matter how much he wanted to be, Gendry knew he would condemn her if he was. And he didn't want that. Not ever. He was just a bastard, his friendship was not worthy to alienate her from her family.

Beside him, Arya struggled in her sleep, like her wolves outside. She even howled silently, sometimes. He should really sleep now, too, and yet all he could do was to lie awake and thinking of what would happen on the morrow. \thought{If we part here, I wouldn't even have to ride. Seven hells, I've got no idea how to ride a horse.}

He knew he should long be asleep, but that did not come easily to him that night.

The next day was even worse than he thought. It did not start out too bad, to be sure. They broke their fasts on what was left from the day before. Cold rabbit, mostly, but \emph{cooked} cold rabbit. Gendry decided he liked that much better than raw cold rabbit. He was about to tell Arya that they would have to part their ways now, when Hot Pie announced he'd stay at the inn.

\enquote{I've been talkin' to the innkeep yesterday, and to his wife, during cooking and later, when you were outside. I don't know where you're goin'. But I just want a place to live, and not one somewhere beneath a wet damp tree. And well … they offered to let me stay. Well, me and Weasel. She's just slowin' you down anyways, it'll be better for her with me here.}

Arya did not say anything, but it was clear she was upset. He wasn't highborn, and he'd never really had friends or companions. Come to think of it, he and Hot Pie weren't really \emph{friends}, were they? Still, you didn't just \emph{leave} the girl who kept you alive for a more than a fortnight either. Then he remembered what he himself intended to do, and resolved to at least give her a warning beforehand.

Before he could say a thing, Arya had already stomped out of the room and outside. Without a look back at Hot Pie, he followed her.

Gendry found her where they'd hidden the deer the day before, next to her giant wolf. \thought{She's hugging it}, he realised, \thought{her wolf comforts her more than I ever could.} There \emph{was} something strange about the relationship between the two.

\enquote{Arya?}, he said, sitting next to her, keeping as much distance as possible from the beast. When she didn't answer, he placed an arm around her. He'd never really done that before, placing an arm around someone, hugging someone, but he felt this wasn't really the right time to ponder about that, not when she was shaking underneath it. \thought{She's almost crying.} Now that was strange, imagining her crying. Furious, shouting, lashing out, yes, but crying? Gendry had never seen her like this before. Not when Lommy had bullied her, not when they found Yoren's body. Not when they passed burned villages and not even when Lommy begged her for death. 

\thought{Maybe it's that while Lommy didn't really have a choice, Hot Pie just left willingly.}

Then he felt even more ashamed of himself, but what was there to help it?

\enquote{Arya?}, he asked her again.

\enquote{Gendry?} She looked up at him. \enquote{Promise me you'll never leave me like that?}

\enquote{I - } \thought{I won't}, he wanted to say, truly did, but … \thought{If I stay, her family will hate her, they'll hate me, they'd - }

\enquote{Gendry?}

\enquote{I - }

\enquote{You want to leave me too, don't you?}

\enquote{No!}, he said, before he could stop himself, \enquote{I don't want  to leave you.}

The look on her face was full of disbelief.
\enquote{Then why can't you just promise me?}

It made no sense to hold it from her. Not anymore. So he told her. Everything. He had wanted to anyways. 
\enquote{Because I have … I have to leave you. Your family … They'd hate me. They'd hate you for befriending me. And - and I couldn't be your friend there. I've told you that. You wouldn't be my friend. You'd be m'lady.}

If anything, that look of disbelief only became stronger.

\enquote{Oh just shut up! If you believe that, you're stupid. Even stupider then I thought. I told you that I don't care. That you would not stop being my friend because everyone wants to turn me into a fucking \emph{Lady!}}

\enquote{But - }

\enquote{But what?}

\enquote{They'll hate you! After you've just come back you'd make them hate you!}

She snorted. \enquote{You know, I think they'd be more surprised if don't show up with a friend who's a bastard. They won't like it, but they'll accept it. And if they don't and if they mistreat you, I swear I'll fight for you.}

\enquote{You'd - }

\enquote{I would. You're my friend, they won't be able to just take that away. And you help your friends, remember? You don't leave them.}

He moved closer to her, his fear of the direwolf forgotten.

\enquote{Arya …} \thought{I can't say how I deserved that. I'm just a bastard. And you just … care about me. And I don't know how to thank you for that.}

He couldn't say that, of course, not loud. It was hard enough to admit it to himself.

\enquote{Now, you promise to stay with me?}

\thought{You don't leave your friends}.

\enquote{Yes.}

She looked at him, and he was sure that ever since he had met her, she had never looked happier.

\thought{Am I truly worth so much, to make her face look like that?}

Gendry had spent his life hating highborns, and now this one looked at him as if he was the most important person in all of Westeros. He wondered when that had happened. Although, when he tried to think who might be most important for him in turn, he knew there was only one possible answer.

They retrieved the meat they had caught yesterday. It was enough for one horse, he supposed, and one would be enough now.

\enquote{Here, you have your meat. We'll get a horse now? Only need one now.}

The man stared at it in a way Gendry could not even begin to describe. \enquote{To be honest}, he admitted, \enquote{I really thought you were joking, had just found what you had yesterday in some abandoned camp. I've given you my word, though, so you'll get your horse. And I'll just refuse to ask where you've got the meat.}

Arya choose the horse, as he didn't know the first thing about horses. It was already saddled, and after he managed to climb on its back - with Arya's help - and she followed after him, much more graceful than he could ever hope to be, they looked at the inn for a last time and rode off into the woods.

Gendry thought he probably should not be so thankful that Arya had crushed his view of the world. Again.






\chapter*{Arya}

\chbegin{B}{y now, Arya was almost sure the woods were cursed.} At the inn, the man had said it would take them only a day, or two at most, to get to Riverrun, but now the second day had almost come to its end and they'd spied neither a castle nor outriders or just \emph{anything}. Only the woods on one side, and the river on the other. And of course, they had to slow down again and again, even stop for what felt like hours because their horse could not live on thin air. \thought{Or Nymeria’s meat}. No, \thought{of course} the stupid horse had to eat grass or vegetables, not meat. She'd curse the gods about this, old and new, but then she remembered what her mother would say to that if she ever learnt of that, and of all the things she'd already done, and just barely managed to stop herself from doing it.

If she'd thought endlessly about the rain before they'd come across the inn, than now she was spending even more time wondering for how long these woods could possibly go on.

Arya knew they were faster with the horse, not slower, she wasn't \emph{stupid}, but it still felt as if they were.

Though Gendry thought quite different, she'd learned.

Riding a horse had always been fun to her, something she'd spend hours trying to convince her mother to let her do, and then doing it anyways when she didn't allow it. Hullen, her father's master of horse, had used to say she rode like a northerner, as good as any southern knight. But Gendry, of course, had never had any lessons on how to ride, or even a horse to teach himself, and half the time he was clinging to her as if he feared he might fall off at any moment.

\thought{As if anyone could just fall of a horse at this speed.}

Well, there was nothing to help it. They already were slow enough, going even \emph{slower} wasn't really an option to Arya, and she was the one with the reins in her hands.

Still, she supposed she \emph{did} feel a bit bad for Gendry, especially when they were forced to make stop for the night again, and she saw the expression of relief on his very-slightly-green face.

\thought{He's stupid enough to get seasick on a horse}, she supposed, \thought{he was stupid enough that he thought he'd have to leave me, after all}.

It wasn't that she couldn't understand his being a bit fearful about it - she was the same, with Robb being King now and all that.

\thought{And with me having killed, and Sansa left behind}, though it was hard to admit that, even to herself.

No, it wasn't that. She just found herself unable to understand how he'd come to think he \emph{had} to leave her, or that her mother would hate her because of \emph{him}. Arya supposed that Lady Catelyn \emph{did} have a lot of reasons to hate her, but he really shouldn't be one of them.

\thought{Well, unless he \emph{does} manage to fall off the horse, drags me down with him and kills us both.}

The thought was so absurd she had to laugh, just a little, but she knew he'd notice it all the same.

Not long afterwards, when the had properly ended and the sun started to disappear behind endless woods and they'd done their best to tie the horse to a particularly strong-looking branch so it wouldn't run off, but still had ample grass to reach they sat down, eating what the innkeep had been kind enough to let them take with them on their way.

Rabbit again, as it had been before the inn, too, but now it was \emph{cooked}, and that was infinitely better than anything else Arya could imagine right now, even if it was cold.

While eating, she idly wondered whether Hot Pie had been the one to cook it, and what he might be doing right now, back at the inn. For some reason he hadn't wanted to go to Riverrun, even though he could've worked there, too, and though the betrayal still stung she couldn't help but hope he'd like it where he was now.

Then she realized that she'd never really told him they'd go to Riverrun, and that of course he didn't know who she was and that she'd be able to get him work, and thought that maybe it wasn't all his fault. How was he supposed to know he'd find work at Riverrun, without her telling him?

Gendry had known, of course, though he'd still tried to leave her. Was that something about her, that people didn't want to be with her anymore, not really? Maybe because of the Stableboy she'd killed, or maybe because of Mycah, who'd died because of her? Did they somehow stick to her, could other people see that she was a killer?

\thought{That's stupid}, she told herself, but still the thought wouldn't go away.

Thankfully, Gendry interrupted her. He had that about him, she'd noticed: he'd somehow always manage to say something to rip her from her thoughts whenever they got all gloomy.

\enquote{You know, I hope the innkeep's right, and we'll be there in a day, or two at most. Nothin' gainst you or your riding, but I wouldn't think I'd survive it too long.}

Half of her wanted to snap that it wasn't her fault, he was just too stupid to properly hold himself up, but mostly she was just thankful that he'd started talking, and soon their conversation served to end her worries for the moment and drifted to other things. Tired as she was, she'd never be too sleepy to trade stories with Gendry, though she sometimes wondered what they'd do if they ever ran out of them. Already, she'd taken to retelling some of Old Nan's stories she'd liked, but of course he'd never had someone to tell him stories when he was sick and had to stay inside for days on end, or when he just didn't want to talk to anyone.

She'd just finished recounting the deeds of Queen Nymeria of the Rhoynar - she'd read them so often, and replayed them so often with Jon in the Broken Tower with their little stone-armies that she knew every battle that Nymeria had ever fought in and every place she'd visited, before landing in Dorne - and now it was his turn. That was how they always did it, after that first time when she'd just told him everything at once: He'd tell her a story, and once finished, she'd tell him one in turn.

This time, though, he started different, not with the usual \emph{you know, when I hadn't yet been an apprentice smith …} 

\enquote{Listen}, he began instead, \enquote{I … ahm … I probably should've told you this already. Really, I should've when you told me who you are, but … I never really felt it fit. Don't think it fits now, either, but in case we arrive tomorrow, and I don't know what happens then, well … } - Arya had half a mind to tell him to not be stupid, that nothing would change even if they \emph{did} arrive the next day, they'd trade stories all the same - but then she'd have to interrupt him, and it had become one of their unspoken rules that they wouldn't interrupt each other during stories, questions were for later - \enquote{you really should now it, I think. While I was with Master Mott … actually just a few weeks ago, though it doesn't really feel like that, I … well - I met your father.}

For half a second Arya was confused, thought she must've misunderstood him, but then realized that she hadn't, which only served to deepen her astonishment. She was on the brink of just bursting out a question, and only managed to stop herself at the last moment.

\enquote{He came, one day, to the forge. I didn't really notice, of course, not at first, he was with Master Mott out in the front. That never was anything unusual, loads of lords and knights came by there every day. I've already told you of Thoros and his flaming sword, haven't I?}

Excitement flooded through her, and a little fearfulness, and while she normally enjoyed Gendry's slowness while narrating, she suddenly felt the urge to shout that she already knew of Thoros, \thought{of course she did, and why can't you just tell me about father … }It took everything she'd learned from Syrio about controlling herself not to.

\enquote{Well, point is, was nothing really unusual, not at first, but then he, Master Mott, that is, suddenly lead him to the forge, behind the selling-room, and then Lord Stark -- well, your father -- said he wanted to talk to me, though first he had a look at my work, you know, at the bull's head helmet, said something of it being fine work. Well, it was a bit rough round the edges, and still is, but … Anyway, I kind of feared he meant to take it with him, but when I told him I wouldn't want to sell it, he said that was all right, though Master Mott threw a frenzy 'bout it. After that, he asked me 'bout Lord Arryn.}

Confusion must have shown on her face, for Gendry stopped himself, looked unsure for a moment, then continued.

\enquote{Oh, sorry, I haven't old you of him yet, either, have I? Well, basically he just came to the forge one day, same as your father, more or less, though he had another one with him. Lord Stannis, I think his name was, the one with the ships, but I'm not sure. Well, he never said anything. Lord Arryn though, he was the hand, of course, before he died, and he - well I suppose he asked me 'bout my mother, 'bout everything I can still remember of her. So I told him, of her yellow hair, and of the songs she used to sing to me - well, I told him that there were songs, I don't remember which ones - and then he left again, while the other one, Stannis, yes, I think that was actually his name, he just stood in the back and stared at me like some … well, like someone he'd didn't really like much, though I never learnt why.}

Arya couldn't help but think that he'd stopped himself there, that he'd wanted to say something else first, but she didn't really care. Not now, not when he was telling him of her father.

\enquote{Anyway, I told your father of Lord Arryn, and then asked me the same things, so I told him, too. Well, I'd kind of expected that, when I'd first seen him. There's only so much that's interesting 'bout a bastard boy from the streets, though I can't for the life of me guess what it might be. But then he did something … well … \emph{weird}. Your father, I mean. He just asked me to look into his eyes - I hadn't done that, Master Mott always said you shouldn't look highborns in the eye, they didn't like that - }

Any other time, Arya would've wondered if that was why he hadn't really looked at her, the first few days after she'd told him who she was, but now that thought didn't even cross her mind.

\enquote{Actually, he didn't really \emph{ask}, it was more like a command, so well, I did, and then he looked at me all strangely as if I'm a ghost and just walks out. Master Mott later told me that outside he'd mentioned that should I ever want to fight with a sword rather than forge one I could go to him, he'd take me, as a guard or something, and I'd wondered 'bout that for a while, thought maybe it had something to do why someone had paid my apprentice fee, but … well … Master Mott just gave me to the Night's Watch later.}

Grateful for not mentioning her father's death, it took her a moment to notice he'd finished talking.

Then realization hit her, and all thoughts of not saying anything or of telling him a story were forgotten.

\thought{Why would father want to look in his eyes? What is it that's so important of Gendry?} She'd long since concluded that there was \emph{something} about him that no one, not even he himself, really knew about. As he himself just said, \emph{someone} had paid for him being at the forge, and she couldn't help but think there was something not quite right about all this.

People didn't just pay for the apprenticeship of random bastards living on streets, there was some secret about Gendry, she was sure of it. But how to find out?

Arya was thoughtful for a moment, then had an idea.

\enquote{Gendry? My father must've recognized something about you when he did that, or at least he'd hoped to, so … well, would you just look at me? Maybe, if he saw something, I'll see it as well.}

His face an expression of confusion, and maybe anxiety, he turned his head towards her and she tried to find something she'd failed to see before.

There just \emph{had} to be something, she knew it.

Though of course she had no idea what to search for. He had the same face he'd always had, the same piercing blue eyes, the same mop of ink-black hair hanging around it, the same nose, the same chin and cheeks she always saw when she looked at him.

But she remembered Syrio, how he'd told her of the trick of not just \emph{looking}, but truly \emph{seeing}.

Was there anyone else she knew, who might look like him? She couldn't imagine why that might be important, but there wasn't anything better that occurred to her, either.

\thought{Black hair …}

It didn't seem remarkable, really, but now that she thought of it, there weren't that many people she knew with hair that black. Her father's had been dark, of course, same as Uncle Benjen's and her own, but not anywhere near \emph{this} dark. Who else? No one of the north, she concluded, even Jory'd had dark brown hair, not black. But in King's Landing had been so many people, and most of them she'd never really paid any attention to …

The King had had black hair, of course, but she couldn't recall the colour of his eyes, and he'd been to fat to really make his face out. Idly she wondered what hair Varys might have; he'd been one of the few to truly stick out in the Red Keep, but he'd always shaved his head. All of the Lannisters were blond-haired, of course, and as far as she remembered the Hound's, while dark, had been brown rather than black.

\thought{Come on! There should be more people you remember!}

Thinking back to when Ser Barristan had welcomed them on the Kingsroad, she remembered his white hair, and …

\enquote{Lord Renly.} She hadn't really seen him often, but there was no way of missing him, with the way he dressed.

\enquote{What?}

If anything, the confusion on Gendry's face had only deepened.

\enquote{Lord Renly. You look exactly like Lord Renly.}

He got his painful-looking thinking-face for a moment, then asked \enquote{You think I'm his bastard or something?}

No, that couldn't be right, now that she thought of it. Her impression of Lord Renly had been one of a young man, younger than her father or Jory, only slightly older than Theon, dressed as if he tried to outshine Sansa. Gendry was Robb's age, or near enough to make no difference.

\thought{He's to young to have fathered Gendry …}

\enquote{No. But maybe … maybe one of his brothers. You said Stannis was with there, together with Lord Arryn, didn't you?}

Though the more she thought of it, the less sense that made. Father hadn't often talked about other lords, but sometimes he'd add something to Maester Luwin's lessons.

\enquote{No, he's not it either, father always said he was honourable. If he'd had bastard, he'd raised him himself, like father did with Jon.}

\enquote{But that only leaves the King,} Gendry told her, sounding astonished of his own words.

\enquote{Yes …}

Arya wondered if he could really be the King's bastard. It would certainly explain a few things. The lords had all come to him because he was King Robert's bastard, not because he was Gendry. Someone had paid his apprentice fee. But there was no reason why the Queen would want him dead or why her father would die just because he knew of Gendry’s parentage. \thought{I’m still missing something. There has to be something else … }But what? It must've been dangerous, if so many people died because of it. Her father had died because of it.

She'd never been so frustrated with not knowing something. It felt as if it was right there, she'd only have to take it, and she'd know why they had killed her father … And yet it eluded her.

\thought{What did father say, before Joffrey demanded his head?}

It was hard to remember; all that had stuck in her mind was the crowd, and the cheering at her father's death, and Yoren finding her and cutting her hair off.

\enquote{Gendry?} \thought{Maybe he'll know.}

It was only then that she noticed the look on his face. It wasn't his thinking-face anymore, more like … pain, and anger, and maybe a little fear. He didn't give any indication that he'd heard her.

\enquote{Gendry?}, she called him again, but he didn't seem to notice.

After trying one more time, she went over to him and placed herself beside him.

\enquote{What's wrong with you now?}

Slowly, he looked up at her. For some reason, Arya could see \emph{fear} in his eyes, and anger, more than she'd ever seen before in them. And at the same time, he somehow managed to look as if he was going to cry.

\enquote{You want 'o know wha's wrong? I'm a bastard. Worse, I'm the bastard of an \emph{old disgusting drunken fool who also was the king}. That's \emph{wrong}. No one ever cares about me, I know that, I'm fine with that, I don't care about them either. Just … I'd hoped there was something about me, anything, but turns out this isn't really 'bout me, just 'bout who fucked my mother years ago, never me. I'm just … nothing …}

\enquote{Shut up, Gendry}, she snapped at him, suddenly angry herself, though she didn't really know whom it was about, only that it wasn't really Gendry, \enquote{\emph{You} are not nothing. I thought I told you that already, when you insisted on m'ladying me. You're Gendry, same as I'm Arya. You hear me? They'll all talk about it, but that's not important, because it isn't true what they say, not really. You're still just Gendry, same as you always were, no matter that you're the King's bastard.}

Looking at him, she thought he might almost have managed a small smile, even though he still looked doubtful. \emph{Stupid!}

\enquote{No, wait. You're not the King's bastard, you're just a stupid bullheaded bastard smith!}

He laughed, startled. Then she hugged him, the way she'd used to hug Jon whenever her mother or Sansa had been mean to him. She didn't really knew if that was right in this kind of situation. She'd never been very good with people, after all, but she supposed that since he'd hugged her when Hot Pie left, that it probably wasn't all too wrong.

\enquote{Though I don't, and no one else should, care about the \emph{bastard} thing.}

For his part, Gendry seemed to surprised to do anything.

\enquote{Arya …}

She drew him tighter.

\enquote{And you're my friend.}

They stayed like this for a long time. It just felt so good to have someone to hug again, a bit like Jon. She'd missed that, and she suspected that Gendry had too. Well, Jon wasn't there, and neither was his mother, but she supposed they still had each other.

Half of her feared he'd ruin it again by saying that he wouldn't be able to stay with her in Riverrun, and when he didn't she found herself thanking all the Gods she'd ever heard of.

Then suddenly she had to laugh, at her hugging Gendry in the middle of this miserable forest, at her father and the Lords Stannis and Arryn, at how easy it had been to figure everything out in the end. She even laughed at King Robert, who'd never learnt that he'd had a much better son than Joffrey ever would.

It didn't take long for Gendry to join in, even though he had probably no idea why she was laughing in the first place, and together they laughed, \emph{really} laughed, and Arya was surprised how good it felt, after so many weeks spent without it, to be careless, just for a moment, to not think about how long the way would be or in which direction Riverrun might be.

Not much later, she fell asleep in Gendry's arms, and dreamt of wolves, and of home.



\chapter*{Gendry}

\chbegin{T}{heir campfire flickered happily} while juice dripped on it from the deer's meat that hung above. It was a risk, of course, but after they hadn't seen anyone else since the inn they both felt secure enough to take it.

Gendry had fastened it on a few crude sticks he'd made from branches found in the forest, while Arya had started the fire. Hot Pie had shown her how to it, he remembered, while scolding himself for not paying attention to how she'd done it.

Roasted meet, that was something he probably wouldn't ever get used to; it wasn't like you got a lot of it when you were a lowborn smith in King's Landing. Meat, especially venison, that was for the rich, for those of a high enough birth to get into the Red Keep, not for bastards like himself.

No, he wasn't used to it, and truth be told, he could barely touch or eat it. That seemed inherently \emph{wrong}, somehow.

Though that was only half the reason, if at all.

\thought{All Seven Hells, does he have to be my father?}

There was still the little chance that Arya might be wrong, of course, not that Gendry would be stupid enough to hope for it. What she'd said made to much sense for that, what with all the odd occurrences around him that had happened over the years.

No, he wouldn't touch the meat.

For a split-second he feared Arya might have taken notice, there was an expression of confusion that crossed her face for the shortest of moments, but than she resumed to eat as if nothing was there. Though she didn't look much happier than he felt, he saw.

Not that she looked all too happy, either, but he suspected it was for different reasons. He'd never had a family, but judging by how often he was anxious of what Arya would say to him every day, it really wouldn't surprise him that she'd be a little worried about what her family would say.

Sometimes he wondered if that was because of him, if she thought about what they'd say about her bringing him along, though he normally managed to dismiss that line of thinking. Most times, anyways. Arya wasn't one to lie easily, he'd learnt that much about her, at least, and she'd said it wouldn't be a problem.

When the sun had fully set it stayed quiet for a long while; it seemed they both were sunken to deeply in their thoughts to start their usual storytelling. In the end, after some half-hearted tries by both of them, they just gave the rest of the deer's meat to Nymeria and her wolves who then devoured it frighteningly fast.

Their fire had long since burnt down when Gendry awoke the next morning, but in the first few rays of sunlight it was still easy to see that nothing had happened. He breathed a sigh of relief; even if he hadn't really thought that anyone would notice the light of it, it was still reassuring that evidently the lands around them were truly save.

Standing up, he made sure that the horse was still bound to the tree where they'd fastened it the day before, then waited for Arya to wake up. Normally they'd start at dawn, no matter if on horseback or not, and he didn't want to end her sleep before he had to. Let her have her sleep; it wasn't as if they were being chased, after all, so they could take their time.

Though normally, she'd wake shortly after him. \thought{Stop making that much noise}, she'd say to him every other day. Grudgingly, he had to admit that he \emph{was} much louder than Arya was, who, when focused on it, could walk an entire day without making a single sound louder than the one made by stepping on a root.

Not that she normally did, of course.

\thought{No, she prefers complaining about how I'm so loud, it wouldn't matter if she'd step on every leaf on purpose.}

Complaining rather loudly, that was.

Though by now, she was more likely to complain about their horse, since of course none of them walked all the time anymore.

Finally, Gendry resolved he had to wake her; he couldn't let her lying on the ground till midday, after all. Her face was turned away from him, with the rest of her comfortably -- that was, as comfortably as you could get on a hard earth-resting-place -- snuggled on the ground, occasionally slashing out in her sleep, like she always did.

That wasn't unusual, Gendry thought, until he turned her head around to try and wake her. Normally that wasn't hard -- Arya was the lightest of sleepers, seemingly always on guard, even when she wasn't awake -- but this time that got no reaction out of her, and he had his hands halfway wrapped around her, to shake her awake, when he saw her eyes, and sprang back as if something'd bitten him.

\thought{Her eyes}, he thought, and \thought{what happened? All Seven, what am I supposed to do?}

The eyes. He couldn't help but stare at them.

They were white, utterly and completely, as if someone had decided to replace them with white glass marbles.

\thought{No, that's not it,} he corrected himself. They weren't \emph{entirely} white. What made them so eerie to look at wasn't the fact that her pupils were missing, it was that there was still structure in her eyes, that he could still see the fine veins embedded in them.

It wasn't as if they'd been replaced, it was as if someone had \emph{turned them around}, and they were now pointing inwards, into her own skull.

He tried and failed to suppress a shudder, then again tried and failed to hold himself on a nearby branch, as to not fall over. Finally, he placed himself beside her.

\thought{What am I supposed to do?}, he wondered, desperately.

What were you supposed to do when you woke up to find your only friend in the world somehow eyes that pointed \emph{inwards}?

After a moment, he realized that normally he'd now ask Arya what to do.

Only, well …

At least she still seemed to be asleep, and slept in the same manner she was wont to. He wondered if he'd still be able to wake her up, and what would happen then. How would \emph{she} react to find her eyes were all wrong? Would it maybe right itself when she woke up? Maybe that had happened before, and she'd know what to do?

But no, somehow he felt this was new, even for her. He'd stayed awake at night before, after all, and though her eyelid had always been closed, he didn't think that they'd hid anything unusual.

Slowly, he felt himself panicking. What if there was nothing to do, and he'd have to carry her to Riverrun? He'd have to leave the horse, of course, he had no idea on how to not fall off without her, he'd have to walk the entire way, but then, it wasn't like he wasn't used to walking. What her family would say once he arrived, though …

Now panic was rushing through him, he could feel it, feel it in every last bit of his body, while he desperately tried to keep it away.

\thought{What should I do?}

Panicking wouldn't help him, he knew, and not doing anything wouldn't, either, but what if he made something wrong? What if he caused Arya to …

\thought{No}, he shouted at himself, \thought{don't think of that. Don't ever.}

Still, he couldn't help it.

Finally, after what felt like days, he gently began to hold her again, shook her, slowly, and hoped against hope that everything would be fine.

While carefully rocking her, trying to keep tears from appearing, because of course they would, because Arya was lying there in his arms and apart from the occasional lashing in her sleep didn't do \emph{anything at all}, didn't move as much as a single muscle, he almost didn't hear her.

\enquote{Gendry?}

Her voice was barely audible, yet he heard it, of course he did, how could he not, and when he looked back at his face her eyes were there again, all normal, as if there'd never been anything wrong with them. He hadn't even seen how that happened, had they slid back in front? Just reappeared?

He couldn't begin to guess, and he didn't care to, either.

\enquote{What happened?}

For a moment, he was overwhelmed by happiness about the fact that she \emph{hadn't even noticed}, there had been nothing wrong with her, after all, of course there hadn't. Gendry wanted to laugh, wanted to shout out into the world that \emph{she's alive!}, but stopped himself to answer her question.

She had a right to know, after all, what had happened.

\enquote{I -- I tried to wake you, but your eyes were all white and strange, and I -- I didn't know what to do, I just -- didn't, but then you woke up, after all, and you're all right, and --}

Frankly, he was surprised she understood anything at all, the way the words tumbled out of his mouth in a -- for him -- completely unusual manner, but then, this wasn't an everyday occurrence, and yet she somehow did.

Then her face went pale, and she whispered a single word, but word that still sent shivers down Gendry's spine.

\enquote{White?}

He nodded, unable to do anything else, but then she'd already stood up, with a strength he hadn't known she possessed, and shouted \emph{\enquote{Nymeria!}} out into the woods.

She was still shaking, later, when she helped him climb on the horse -- \emph{Fatigue}, she'd named it while riding the day before, because she'd said the horse was to tired to go any faster and constantly needed to stop and eat -- and for the entire day it felt like she pressed herself closer to him, or maybe tried to get away from him, so he wouldn't notice. Gendry hadn't thought that was possible, and yet it somehow was exactly what she did.

Her wolf took its time to reappear after she'd called for the beast; it was halfway to midday when their horse suddenly broke to run while grassing in one of the rare clearings in the forest and Arya had to keep it back, while Gendry felt for the hundredth time as if he was about to fall off.

Gendry had hoped it would lighten her mood somewhat, or make the shivering cease, but if anything, it seemed to grow more violent.

When the sun had reached its peak and turned, and they had to stop yet again -- which made Gendry feel a little more secure on the beast -- he finally resolved to ask her what was wrong, even though her manner told him she wouldn't like speaking about it.

As expected, she glared at him, but only for a moment, and then the paleness returned again, as if she was deathly frightened of something.

\enquote{You can tell me}, he tried to reassure her, \enquote{remember that I promised I'd be there for you in case you ever wanted to talk? Besides, you know 'bout me being that fat King's bastard, I won't go telling your secrets.}

He'd meant the last bit to lighten the mood, though he immediately regretted it. If anything, it made it even worse, be it because Arya thought this wasn't anything to laugh about, or because he'd attempted to make a joke about something he himself wasn't happy with in the least.

Still, eventually, she looked at him as directly as she could, sitting in front of him on there mare's back, and whispered silently, in that same voice she'd used that morning:

\enquote{I think I'm a warg, Gendry.}

It took him a moment to realize what she was saying; while she had told him stories about wargs while they'd been trading stories, it wasn't all that long ago that he'd never heard of one, except maybe Lord Bloodraven.

He was at loss on what to say to that, though.

How had that idea wormed its way in her head?

\enquote{You know, when I sleep … I'm always dreaming of wolves, I \emph{am} a wolf while I sleep … and, well, sometimes I see you, and me myself, too, sleeping on the ground.}

He was about to say that didn't really mean anything; while strange, it might have just been a coincident without meaning, but she beat him to it.

\enquote{I know that doesn't make anything real … just, when you woke me and said that … well, in Old Nan's stories wargs always had eyes without any black in them, and …}

There was no need for her to end that sentence, Gendry could imagine it easily enough. \thought{What if she's looking out of Nymeria's head while asleep?}

For a while they rode in silence, with Gendry almost wondering if that was all, then she said, \enquote{In stories, wargs are always bad people, the kind that feast on human flesh.}

There was fear in her voice, and maybe even disgust; Gendry couldn't be too sure, he'd never been one to easily pick up other people's feelings. Still, it was plain as day that she wasn't happy about it. He wondered if that was how he'd sounded, when she'd deduced that he was that fat king's son.

\enquote{Arya, I don't think you're eating humans behind my back.}

Jokes and Gendry had never particularly agreed with each other, and though it was meant to not be serious it somehow managed to sound sincere out of his mouth; as if he'd really believe that her eating human flesh was a possibility.

Gendry had half a mind to curse himself for that.

\enquote{What about other people?}, she asked, her voice a whisper barely loud enough to be heard.

He just barely stopped himself from retorting \thought{I thought you didn't care about other people's rumours?}, but it really wasn't the time for that.

\enquote{What if they think me a monster? What if people start to fear me because … because of Nymeria? What … they'll hate me, I know they will. I don't really want people to be afraid of me. Are … Are you afraid of me, Gendry?}

Tough he might not be good at picking up hidden signs in people's speech, even Gendry noticed that last question was meant to sound firm, like a trivial thing, but came out instead with all the fear Arya didn't want to show. \thought{She truly is afraid}, he realized. How strange that was, for him, to see her afraid. Even when they'd defended that cursed holdfast against Lord Amory's men she hadn't sounded like she did now; anxious, fearful even, yes; but never quite as shaken. Gendry had become so used to her being a steady point of security on their flight, he hadn't even noticed it till now.

Again, he remembered that night when he'd told her of Lord Stark's visit, and how she'd joked to cheer him up again. He wasn't great on wit, had never been, but he had no idea what else to try and do.

So he answered: \enquote{How could I not? You're the one who's saved my life more than once; anyone stupid enough to do that must be utterly \emph{mad}.}

As soon as the word left his mouth, he knew it was terrible, before Arya had even had a chance to react, his mind was full of thoughts akin to \thought{Oh dear, there goes another failed joke.}

And yet, \emph{somehow}, he felt Arya soften against him, just a bit; and though he couldn't see her face at all he desperately hoped it had been enough to get a little grin on her face, even if he severely doubted it.

\enquote{But that's just you, Gendry. Others \emph{will} think me a monster, and even … even if I wasn't in Nymeria every night, I'm still … I've killed, Gendry. \emph{Killed}. I know I'll never be a lady, never be as good as Sansa, but even so … they'd try to make me one, again, they'd never let me out of my chamber again …}

\thought{You only killed because you had to}, he wanted to tell her, but felt that it wasn't the time for that; she had not yet finished speaking, after all.

\enquote{They won't want me anymore. I'm supposed to be a lady, but I'm not, I tried, I \emph{did}, truly, but … but I failed, and … mother won't want me, not as me myself, I've got so much blood all over me, I even was the one to kill Lommy, and I can't ever be what she wants me to, she was always angry with me, same as the Septa - she's dead now, I suppose, I know she is, and Sansa is still in King's Landing, and …}

\enquote{We have to go back}, she suddenly interrupted herself, forcefully cutting her own quiet ramblings that Gendry didn't know how to react to off. Then she drew the reins around, and before he could say a word the horse complied and had turned as well.

\enquote{Arya, why - what are you doing?}

\enquote{I have to get back}, she said, determination now filling her voice, \enquote{Sansa is still there; I've seen her the day they murdered father. It was never meant to go like it did; Yoren told me afterwards, they'd meant for him to take the black. But Joffrey - he just killed him anyways. I've \emph{seen} it, Gendry, before Yoren made me look away, I've seen them all shouting - Varys, even the Queen - have seen them all shouting at Joffrey, because no one had wanted to kill him. It was only Joffrey. \emph{Joffrey!}}

Arya worked herself further into her rage; she started to shout.

\enquote{Just Joffrey. \emph{I'll kill him!} I'll go back there and kill him, and his mother, and maybe even his land-burning grandfather if he's there, and then I'll get Sansa out - }

\enquote{\emph{Arya!}}, he shouted at her, but it was no use.

\enquote{\emph{No!} I'll go back there, and you are \emph{not} going to stop me, Gendry!}

With a start, he realized she slowed down. Soon they stood still beside the river, with him wondering as to \emph{why}.

\enquote{Get off, Gendry. I know you don't want to come with me, I understand that, so \emph{get off}. I'd give you the horse and ride Nymeria, but you don't know how to even stay \emph{on} it anyways. Just go on to Riverrun, the man at the inn said Edmure's taking in refugees, and - }

\enquote{No.}

Gendry was surprised how sure he sounded; how sure he'd cut her off, but found that he \emph{was} determined enough to stop her.

\enquote{Arya}, he started, desperately trying to talk sense in her, \enquote{Do you really want to go back? After all this endless travelling, when you're almost there, just to kill that mad shit?}

\enquote{I'm going back to save Sansa.}

\enquote{After almost getting \emph{killed} more than once, when your family thinks that you're either captive or maybe \emph{dead}, you don't even want to assure them you're still alive?}

For a moment she was still, then she seemed to break in his arms. She didn't cry, not a single tear was running down her cheeks, but suddenly she seemed to be needing his support to stay on the horse, not like before.

Gendry tried to hug her as best as it was possible on the horse, when he'd already had his arms around her. Still, Arya seemed to notice, and leaned back against him, almost seemed to cave in against him.

\enquote{Gendry? I don't know what to do.}

He'd thought it all but impossible for her voice to grow even weaker than before, and yet it was, now.

Though Gendry thought the answer obvious, he still took time to think about it again before answering her. Maybe it was that tone of her voice that made it, or that she'd never admitted to \emph{not} knowing what to do, or maybe that he sensed that she \emph{truly} had absolutely no idea on how to proceed.

\enquote{Go to your family, I'd say}, he answered her then, \enquote{you're almost there; at least let them know you live. You can always turn back later. You managed to escape King's Landing, remember? If you want to, I'm sure you'll get out of Riverrun again, even if you're not allowed to.}

\enquote{You sure?}

\enquote{I'll help you.}

\enquote{Promise me?}

For a moment he wondered if he should back down; with Arya, there was no telling what he might get himself into.

\enquote{I promise.}

To his relief, Arya started the horse towards Riverrun.

A few miles down the road, when he was finally sure Arya wouldn't reconsider, he told her: \enquote{Arya, remember what you said about me being a bastard, and the king's bastard at that? Even if you truly are a warg, you're still the same Arya, everyone who thinks different is just wrong.}

He couldn't see her face, of course, but still thought she smiled at that.

Miraculously, they spied Riverrun not two hours later, sitting proudly right in the middle of the river, with red-and-blue banners displayed, and the gray direwolf of Stark flying above it. And when the outriders spied them and asked them who they were, Arya was back to her usual self again, to Gendry's relief.





\chapter*{Epilogue}

\chbegin{T}{he baker's boy made some bread.} Nice, good bread, not like the tough chewy one they'd had here before he'd showed up. That had been a few days ago, three or four, maybe. It wasn't like he counted; he was just glad to finally be somewhere with a decent oven again; and with people to \emph{talk} to, with whom you could be sure that their pets wouldn't just decide you'd make for a nice midday meal.

It was nice, he thought, to be in a warm kitchen again, with some bread to break his fast on, and a bed to sleep in.

He tried to remember when he'd last had one, before. It must've been when his mother had still been alive, years ago, before he'd lived on the streets. \thought{She taught me how to bake pies}, he remembered, \thought{and what lovely hot pies they were.}

He wished he could make some, good, warm and crunchy venison pie, but that wasn't possible, of course. The innkeep, Joseth, didn't exactly have much meat to spare -- what Gendry and Arry had left he'd saved for guests.

\enquote{First rule of runnin' an inn}, he'd said to him on his first day, \enquote{whenever possible, have meat for the guests. Or have you ever seen a noblemen who likes to go without it? I haven't, and I've run this inn for forty years.}

So they'd covered as much of it in salt as they could -- but salt was prized, and of course it hadn't been enough. Not long afterwards they'd cooked what was left, enough for a feast -- \enquote{Well, if we can't help it, it can't be helped}, Meg, Joseth's wife had said, \enquote{I'm certainly not complaining.}

And though he himself had had his doubts -- that meat \emph{had} been caught by a giant monster, after all -- he'd had to admit that the meat \emph{was} lovely, the few bits he'd tried.

But then, as if someone had noticed the smell a band of outlaws had come running in -- Lord Beric, their leader had called himself, he remembered, though he doubted that the man had ever truly been one -- and before any of them had even realized what was going on they'd taken almost all of it and were gone again, only leaving dirt in the common room, together with a piece of parchment, with some lines of writing on it. Neither Joseth nor his wife could read, however, and he couldn't, either, so it wasn't like it had done them much good.

Joseth had been furious, of course -- though at least they hadn't discovered the salted meat they'd stored in the little room behind the kitchen -- but the boy had secretly been almost glad of its disappearance. 

There was something about the meat Arry provided that made him uneasy, even when he'd caught it herself, not with that terrible beast; there was a sense of \emph{wrongness} around him. Arry must've been years younger than the boy himself, and he'd noticed that even Gendry was wary of getting closer to that monster than necessary, no matter if he was twice as tall as Arry or not.

\thought{It's not like I'm easily afraid}, he told himself, \thought{I've lived in the streets of King's Landing half my life, and I never was too frightened then.}

But with Arry … it wasn't just the beast; even before that, he'd been the only one who could hunt, had been able to beat \emph{him} bloody to the point that he couldn't walk for \emph{days} without much visible effort. He wasn't even afraid of sparring with the Bull, and worse, he supposed it wouldn't even be too surprising if Arry would've actually won such a match.

\thought{And he killed Lommy.}

If anything, he thought, that was it what had truly terrified him.

These last two days Lommy had still been alive … they'd had to carry him, of course, and his back had hurt as if it'd been roasted in one of the pot shops, but still. He had been \emph{alive}, even if he'd begged for death.

He'd been so certain that in a couple of days, Lommy would be all right again …

If only they'd made it to this inn with him still alive, maybe …

But of course Arry just \emph{had} to kill him. As if he didn't care at all. One morning, he'd woken up to find his friend dead, and a pool filled with his life's blood beside him.

Who \emph{wouldn't be} terrified of that \emph{creature}? Every night after that, he'd feared it might have been the last time for him to close his eyes, had wished he could just run away, but of course he couldn't. Arry might kill him any time without him ever being warned, but he was also the only one between him and certain death from hunger.

With a start, he realized that his dough was now as hard as a piece of old, dry meat.

\thought{You're thinking too much}, he told himself, \thought{thinking about these two won't do you any good.}

Trying to distract himself, he added the appropriate amount of water, and started kneading it again. There was an art to it, he'd learnt that long ago. People always thought that surely making bread must be simple, and in theory, it was: Just take some water, add some flour, mix everything together and put it in an oven.

Most people never just realized just how wrong they were.

So he continued, hoping beyond hope he hadn't done something wrong. He hadn't made any bread in a while, after all, nor for a long time. There was a reason others called him \emph{Hot Pie}, and it wasn't that he was known for making bread. Still, while it might not be his best attempt at it, he supposed it should be more than simply edible.

Making bread. \emph{That} was what he knew, not how to fight or how to live in the wild for \emph{ages}. At first, it had seemed so simple as well -- he remembered thinking that in Yoren's camp, that all you had to do was to appoint a guard and have someone to hunt -- but as with making bread there were a hundred little things you could do wrong.

\thought{Only with baking, you'll never wake up to find your friend's been murdered.}

He tried to avoid it, \emph{really} tried, but before long his thoughts drifted again, and he found himself wondering what had happened to them. To Arry and the Bull. He hadn't liked either of them, but he supposed it was always hard to get people out of your head once you'd travelled with them for close to a fortnight.

Then he realized what he was doing, and cut that train of thought off short.

\thought{Thinking about them will do you no good}, he reminded himself again. Once, he'd had a dream of becoming a knight, a long time ago. And while he'd of course learnt that he couldn't ever be one, he'd liked to imagine that being at the Wall was something similar; in a way, he'd defend the weak, like any good knight should, even if it was just by cooking for his brothers. Thinking back, he wondered if Gendry or Arry had ever had any intention of actually joining the Watch.

\thought{Maybe the Bull}. He had no such hopes about Arry, though.

But then, not a fortnight after they'd set out from King's Landing, Yoren had died, Lommy had first been wounded and then died, after Cutjack and Tarber had left. Then of course there'd been the Goldcloaks wanting the Bull, and Lumpyhead turning out to be more beast than boy.

\thought{Maybe}, he supposed, \thought{it should have been a warning that he thought they were after him. He must've done something before, in the city, and was forced to flee, like a criminal.}

No, not \emph{like} a criminal. He \emph{was} a criminal, there was no doubting that. 

The dough was almost ready by now, and he shaped it into a nice loaf of bread and just wanted to search for some firewood when he heard the shouting.

\thought{Guests? Now?}

It was just mod-morning; in King's Landing it was seldom for an inn to have any costumers before at least noon. But then again, he himself hadn't exactly arrived at anything like a normal time, either.

\thought{Anyways, it's not my job to deal with guests.}

That was an innkeep's task, not a baker's.

While he continued his work, slowly, there were voices floating through the door, low at first, then gradually rising louder and louder until it was the heat of an argument that reached his ears, terrible shouting that stroke fear in him, though he couldn't really tell why, or even really think about it.

Finally, the spell was broken when he heard something falling to the floor, a \emph{flapping} sound, not like the one a loaf of bread or a plate would make. With a start he recognized it; it was the peculiar, singular sound made by a body falling on the ground. He'd heard it before, after all, in King's Landing and when Yoren had been killed.

In a moment of deafening silence, he realized that someone must've slit Joseth's throat. Only a moment later he could hear Meg crying out, while he frantically searched for a place to hide.

\thought{The storeroom, with the meat, maybe?}

No, surely not, whoever this was, he was bound to open it sooner or later. No one killed an innkeep without having a look at his kitchen.

Shaking and shuddering, his eyes fell on the oven, right beside the door, with a small space behind it, not visible for someone stumbling in unless he knew where to look for it. There was already a fire lit inside of it for the bread he'd been making, and its backside was hot enough to fry an egg, but he didn't really care.

While Meg's scream grew lower and slowly died, he crawled into his new-found hiding-place, desperately trying not to make a single sound.

\thought{No, wait!}, he wanted to cry out at the world, \thought{this isn't how it's supposed to be! That's all wrong, it should've been safer here!}

With a remarkable effort, he just barely managed not to scream out in terror when the man came through the doorway.




\part{To ride in the pack}


\chapter*{Catelyn}

\chbegin{W}{hen they told Catelyn that her daughter was outside}, she feared that she had finally lost her mind to grief. Surely she must be dreaming, or else had misunderstood the steward's words. But Utherydes Wayn, old as he was, gave her a nod and repeated what Catelyn had just heard, so she found herself leaving her father's bedside, racing down the spiral staircase into the yard as fast as her feet would carry her.

Outside, with the sun just past midday casting sharp shadows on the ground, it seemed that nothing at all had changed; it was the same yard, the same walls, the same heads being displayed above them, and yet everything was different.

There was her daughter standing right in its middle.

\thought{Arya!}

For a moment she couldn't believe; how was it possible for Arya to stand just past the main gate of her grandfather's castle, when by all accounts she was Joffrey's hostage, or dead? But those thoughts were pushed away as Arya broke into a run, a run towards her.

\enquote{Mother}, was all she said, and then she'd already launched herself into Catelyn's arms.

And Catelyn hugged daughter fiercely, held her closer than she ever had before.

\thought{She's here}, was all she could think, \thought{She's really here.}

They must have stood like this for a long time, but it felt like no time at all. Certainly much too short to make up for all the time of uncertainty, for all the fear, for all the \emph{loss}.

Only then did she let her daughter go, to get a more proper look at her.

She was thin. Shockingly so.

\thought{If she was as skinny as a stick before, then what is she now? A needle?}

And covered with bruises, in an alarming variety of sizes and colors.

With all that, Catelyn nearly did not notice her short, butchered hair, the rags that had presumably once been here clothes, her missing shoes or the sword fastened to her waist.

\thought{That doesn't matter. Not now. Not when I just got her back.}

And after seeing her face, thin and weak and starved, she could not help but press Arya to her again, and stay like this some more, wishing it could last forever, the happiness she felt with her daughter pressed to her chest for the first time in months.

It was only later when should looked up again, to see a giant wolf, larger even Grey Wind had been the last time she'd seen him, the surprisingly expensive-looking horse beside it and the boy, his every movement screaming discomfort and uncertainty. He turned away quickly once he noticed her gaze, but she'd already seen his face, if only for half a heartbeat. And suddenly she was in that lavish tent again with a shadow creeping on the floor, a murderous knife in its hand.

\thought{No}, she thought, \thought{That can't be, I've seen him stabbed just a few days ago …}

And yet here he stood.

Arya must have noticed that she looked somewhere else, for she drew out of the hug and looked up to her.

\enquote{Mother?}, she asked her, following Catelyn's eyes, and when she saw them glued to the boy she added: \enquote{Why are you staring at him? That's just Gendry. I've met him on the road. He's my -- } she stopped there for just a moment, as if considering her choice of words, \enquote{He's a friend of mine.}

\thought{Gendry}, she thought, \thought{Yes, right. I just mistook him.} He obviously was to young to be Renly, and whatever else she'd thought of Renly and his arrogance, he'd have never let himself be caught in clothes such as the ones this boy wore. Still … the similarities could not be denied. His hair might be messy, but it was of the same ink-black, and should he ever comb it out she doubted that there would be a visible difference. His cheekbones and the shape of his face might be slightly different, but eyes with the same piercing blue colour stared out of it. Some part of her wondered how Brienne might react once she saw him. The girl might have pledged her sword to Catelyn, but it was obvious to anyone who looked at her -- not that many did -- that she would never forget Renly.

For a moment she thought of her wedding, then, where she'd married a stranger she'd never seen before in her life, who'd borne such a resemblance to his brother …

Arya still stared at her, and by now the boy -- Gendry -- had noticed as well and looked right back at Catelyn, it seemed.

\thought{No}, she observed, \thought{He's not looking at me. He's looking at Arya.}

It took her a moment to return to the present, to get the thoughts of shadows and strange powers out of her mind.

\enquote{Pardon my confusion}, she said, turning to her daughter again, \enquote{You really should eat something, Arya, you look thinner than I have ever seen you.}

Catelyn had always hoped that maybe one day they could've visited Riverrun, all of them, and she'd have shown her children where she had grown up. But that was not meant to be, so instead, Arya got her first glimpse of Riverrun's great hall starved from her flight, while her mother quickly instructed Utherydes Wayn -- who had followed her down into the yard -- to get as to eat for Arya as the kitchens were able to provide on such a short notice.

Upon entering Arya seemed unsure, just for a moment, then she turned round, gestured to the boy -- Gendry, Catelyn reminded herself -- to follow her inside. If he'd been unsure of himself before, than she truly did not know how to describe his stance now. In a way, she supposed he resembled a man waiting to attend his own trial for murder, knowing he will probably either go to the Wall or die.

For once disregarding every rule of court her Septa had once taught her she placed them both at the high table, and then hoped that food would arrive rich and plentiful, and, above all, \emph{quickly}.

None of them spoke a word while waiting; it would have been polite, but this time she really couldn't fault Arya for ignoring it, and she doubted the boy knew what was considered polite at a high table. \thought{What an odd sight we must make, a young lady without shoes, dressed as a peasant's boy together with her lowborn friend sitting at the high table of mighty Lord Tully's castle.}

Especially the boy. \thought{I wonder if Maester Vyman will put down a record of this day, saying it was the first for a commoner to ever sit on Riverrun's dais.} Though with his look, she didn't doubt he was the bastard of one Baratheon or other, and given Renly's age and Stannis's sternness it was clear he must be Robert's. She wondered how he had found his way here. Men acted strange about their bastards, she had found; her own Ned would never tell her who this woman was, this shadow that lay between them, not even if she was even still alive. And only a few days ago one of Lord Bolton's ravens had arrived, carrying a letter saying that he was sure Harrenhal would be Robb's within the week, and that he hoped it would serve as proof of his loyalty after what his own bastard had done in the North, where Ser Rodrick Cassel had put him to death. \thought{A fate he no doubt deserved}, had said the letter.

With Gendry here, and apparently on his way to join the Night's Watch, she supposed King Robert hadn't been as generous to his bastards as some other men were. She wondered what he might have done to warrant a trip to the Wall, and whether or not Arya knew. Right now, he looked more shy than anything, not only not having spoken a single word since he stepped inside the courtyard, but also desperately trying not to stand out, which achieved the exact opposite result -- if anything, his squirming served to make him noticeable. The bull's head helmet that he'd carried with him before now lay on the floor next to him, while he himself did not look too different from Arya, being garbed in similarly ruined clothes, carrying a sword -- she'd need to do something about that, later, both with him and Arya. Openly carrying a sword inside the walls of Riverrun would not do either of them any good, if for different reasons -- although he, at least, still wore shoes.

Thankfully, it wasn't long until the food was brought; bread with cheese and bacon, some boiled eggs. Overall, nothing complicated, or warm, just what could be brought at a moment's notice, though Arya didn't seem to mind. After shoving half a loaf of bread into her mouth -- if anything, her regards for table manners had evidently worsened, not that Catelyn was surprised or minded it right now -- she stopped just long enough to jokingly tell her friend that yes, he could eat the food, it wasn't poisoned, but then continued as if she was a hungry direwolf in winter.

\thought{Not that wrong a description, I suppose.}

And while Gendry still looked doubtful, eventually he grabbed a bit of it, too, and to Catelyn's amazement he ate it more politely than her own daughter did. But then again, in all likelihood he feared to be thrown out of the castle should he do anything wrong, and Catelyn wasn't even sure if that was untrue. It was her brother's decision, after all, though she thought the boy hardly had anything to fear. Already, there were all kinds of people in this castle; half the commoners of the Riverlands seemed to have poured through those fish-adorned gates, and though the boy probably was from Kng's Landing and not her brother's own lands, it would be very unlike him to throw someone out, especially if his niece requested otherwise.

To tell the truth, he probably had nothing at all to fear.

\thought{If only the same could be said of me.}

Edmure had shown her his plans for battle almost the moment she had returned with Brienne, and while he and his bannermen all agreed on their own ingenuity, Catelyn herself could not help but fear for her sweet little brother who'd let the smallfolk in his castle, the way she already had to fear for Sansa and her sons.

\thought{Foolish woman}, she told herself, \thought{you should be praising the Seven for returning your daughter, not sitting here, thinking of battles yet to be fought.}

She dearly hoped her fears did not show on her face, so Arya might not be scared more than she already was. No matter how exactly she had made her way to Riverrun, Catelyn doubted it had been a happy voyage. While returning after Renly had been murdered by that abomination she herself had been forced to travel closer to the fighting that she would have wished, but she'd had Hallis Mollen and his guards around her. To be there without them, virtually unprotected …

No, she wouldn't share her fears with Arya. She deserved comfort now, not more worries.

When her worst hunger was stilled, her daughter looked up for a moment, asked \enquote{Where's Robb?}, before immediately returned to her food.

\enquote{He's in the west, raiding Lord Tywin's lands. The Greatjon has plundered the mines at Castamere, and Robb himself has taken Ashemark and is marching on to the Craig, after winning a great victory at Oxcross, defeating an entire host.}

She continued to tell all the lovely little stories Martyn Rivers and his scouts had told her, hoping her daughter would find them more comforting than she herself had.

But \enquote{Well, that's good, I suppose} was all she said, and Catelyn feared that her daughter had seen right through her feeble attempts to put her at ease.

\thought{She won't calm until Robb has returned, victorious, from the battlefield.}

Again, Catelyn wondered what had happened to her daughter. Not even a year ago, Robb, and Jon Snow, as well, had been Arya's heroes and she would've never believed that anyone could harm them -- and yet now the look on her face together with the low, depressing voice told her an entirely different story.

\thought{Oh Ned, why did I persuade you to go with your King?}

If only they had all remained at Winterfell, none of this would have ever happened; or if, at the very least, her Ned would have gone to King's Landing alone, so her daughters would be safe at home. What was it that Arya had experienced out there, that had changed her so?

She almost feared to ask. Yet what kind of mother would she be, when she could not bear to hear what her daughter had been forced to live?

\enquote{So}, she finally started, after seemingly endless moments spent with searching for the right words, \enquote{How did you get out of King's Landing? I don't suppose it was the Imp who let you go, or Petyr?} She might not be sure anymore on whose side he was on, but Catelyn allowed herself the spot of hope.

\enquote{No they didn't}, Arya exclaimed, as if her mother had just insulted her.

\enquote{Then who?} \thought{Surely not Cersei.} For a moment she entertained the thought of Lord Varys; he was just as plausible as any other, she supposed, and with him no one ever knew what his true ends were.

\enquote{Out the Red Keep, I myself. Then, out of King's Landing, Yoren.}

\thought{Yoren?} She vaguely remembered having heard that name before, somewhere, though she couldn't quite place it.

\enquote{He chopped my hair of, told the guards I was a boy on the way to the Night's watch and got me out with the other recruits. We went north. He wanted to bring me back to Winterfell.}

Her voice had assumed a wistful tone now, as if she fondly remembered being safe, though Catelyn shuddered to think of what else she might have encountered that she thought of travelling with criminals as \emph{safe}. She hid her troubles, much as she could. But at least she could place Yoren, now, he'd been one of the black brothers who'd come down south with the Imp.

\enquote{I met Gendry there. He was the only one who'd help me, and I helped him, a bit. I caught a rabbit once, I shared it with him … Anyways, Yoren was killed by Ser Amory Lorch, near the Gods Eye. He burned the holdfast we'd slept in and killed most of the others, too. A few escaped with us, though. One of them died a short time after, and the rest abandoned us, sooner or later.}

Catelyn wondered what was worse, the terrors she was describing or the sound of the voice she was using; a voice one might use to tell of a dream, of something that had not been real at all.

\thought{It's something she doesn't want to be real}, Catelyn sensed.

\enquote{After that we just walked through the woods. Since Winterfell was to far and we'd heard that Robb had come south, I figured he might be here. Nymeria kept us save, after she found me again. And provided us with bits of meat to eat, from whatever her pack had left. She scared the horse a bit, though.} There was a half-smile on her face, the wistful smile of someone who didn't smile at all, in truth. In a way, it would've been more bearable if she'd shouted, or even cried. But then Arya had always tried not to cry when she could avoid it.

With all that on her mind, it took her half a moment to truly understand what she had heard, that Arya had escaped with the Night's watch, only to then see the man who had promised to protect her slaughtered, forcing her to walk almost all the way to Riverrun -- which was a long way, even with a horse. All the same, she sent a silent thank to the Seven for this Yoren and cursed Lord Tywin's mad dogs for killing him. But there were more questions, of course. There always were, with Arya.

\thought{Who is this boy there, and why was he there? And - }

\enquote{Did you say you escaped the Red Keep \emph{yourself}?}

\enquote{Yes. Well, Syrio - Syrio helped me. When they came to take me he noticed that Father would never have sent Lannister men to fetch me. He held them back, too, killed three guardsmen and fought Ser Meryn with only a wooden sword. He told me to run. I didn't want to leave him, but he \emph{told} me to. He must be dead now, I think. Father hired him for me, after he'd found Needle -- my sword. After that I ran down into the dungeons, through the room with the dragon skulls and outside. I'd been there, before, so I knew there was a way out. After that I lived on the streets -- Syrio had taught me how to hunt cats, and pigeons are easy once you know cats. Anyways, I found the boat that Father had arranged for, but I didn't know the men there, so I stayed away. Still, I looked every day if maybe there was something to get me out, the gates were closed, but then … }

\enquote{Then?}, Catelyn asked, while she suspected she already knew -- and dreaded -- the answer.

\enquote{Then they killed him. One day, the bells were ringing, and someone told me what it meant. I was there.}, she said, her voice impossibly low before it faded out altogether. Then she spoke up again, calmer than she'd ever heard her: \enquote{Yoren found me there.}

\thought{By all Seven, why did she have to see it?} It had been bad enough for Robb and her, just reading that letter carrying dreadful news, knowing Ned was gone. Catelyn could not begin to imagine how it might have been to see the blade cutting her husband's head from his shoulders. And Arya was so young. She tried to remember what she had done at that age, and all that came back was playing with Lysa and Petyr, covered in mud. If she had lost her own father at that age … She did not know what she would have done. \thought{Now I'm sitting here, more than thrice her age, and complain how hard it is to loose a father while I sit by his bedside all the time, while my daughter has gone through all this already, and in a much more brutal fashion than I will.}

Catelyn placed her arm around her, and drew her as close as was possible could on the high, carved chairs of the high table. The boy, sitting across the table, reached across it, to place his hand on Arya's shoulder, and to her surprise Arya didn't push him away. 

\enquote{Arya?} both the boy and Catelyn asked her.

\enquote{It's all right.} she insisted, no matter how obvious the lie was, and neither of them drew away, though Gendry looked more than a bit uncomfortable about it.

\enquote{No, really, it's all right}, she repeated, pushing them away, \enquote{It's just - I don't know. I didn't even see it, Yoren made me look away before - before Ser Ilyn - } she stopped, just for a moment, and a single tear could be seen leaving her eyes, \enquote{But I saw the sword. Ice, it was \emph{Ice} they used, I saw it, saw it when Ser Ilyn held it high, before Yoren grabbed me. I tried to get through, through the crowd, to get to him. I had my sword, I wanted to help him, but I just … I just couldn't even come \emph{close} to him. I couldn't help him, all I could do was let him die there.} Catelyn drew her close again, this time lifting her from her own chair, placing her on her lap. Arya let her mother embrace her, comfort her, while all the time she wept on her shoulder.

After a moment, she noticed the boy across the table staring at them, and had half a mind to send him away, but stopped herself short. \thought{Arya asked for him to be in this hall, and maybe he's the only one she ever truly spoke to since Ned died.}

For a fleeting second she thought of Brienne, and of how she would only confide in her. Maybe they were similar, after a fashion.

\enquote{I couldn't save him}, her daughter told her, as if apologizing for it, while she wept and wept, tears running down on her mother's shoulder.

\enquote{There was nothing you could do}, Catelyn told her, making her voice as firm as she could so she wouldn't break in tears as well, \enquote{Nothing. You should not blame yourself.}

\thought{If there's anyone to blame, then it's me}, she thought, \thought{I was the one who convinced him of accepting the position as Hand, and to go to King's Landing. I thought I was doing my duty at the time, but now I'm not so sure.}

\thought{Family, Duty, Honour}. The words of her house. But what was she supposed to do when her family was scattered, and didn't know what her duty might be?

After a sob, Arya replied: \enquote{Not blame myself. Yes}, she sobbed, \enquote{Father said that, too, when the Hound killed Mycah.}

Slowly, her weeping ebbed, the sobs softening away, while she wiped the tears from her face. And only a moment later, there was no hint she had been crying left at all, and her daughter looked as strong as she had before.

\thought{It's like a mask now}, Catelyn realized, \thought{she puts it on, so no one can see her pain.}

But before she could think on what to do about that, Arya was already speaking again.

\enquote{Is Sansa still -- }

\enquote{Yes}, Catelyn answered, before she could say the name of that, of that \emph{place}, before she could make her think of that monster that had Sansa in its grasp. She did enough of that already, and there truly was no need to talk of it, too.

\enquote{Bran and Rickon?}

\enquote{They're safe at Winterfell.}

Arya gave a sigh of relief.

There was another question there, which she had left unspoken, she sensed. That of her bastard brother. Catelyn knew her daughter, and knew that she seldom spoke of him in her mother's presence, only to then run off outside with him all day whenever she wasn't looking.

\enquote{Jon Snow is still at the Wall, safe}, she said, and mentioning that name was more than worth the smile it put on Arya's lips.

\thought{Let her smile again}, Catelyn prayed, \thought{truly smile, not with the mask. Let her forget all this ever happened, let it seem like a bad dream that means nothing ones the sun rises in the morning.} Yet in her heart she knew that would never happen. In her heart, she knew her daughter had seen the horrors of this world, and would never become that careless, easy-laughing girl again.

For a long time they just stayed there in front of the high table, and hoped that time itself would bend around them to make this moment last forever, but of course that would not happen. Someone had to tell her brother, someone had to send a raven to Ashemark, already the second today, though bearing much happier words than the first. Someone had to find her a room, and maybe even find a septa to continue her lessons. Yet for now, she wanted to do nothing else than embrace her daughter, and never let her go again.

But of course, the world would not stay outside but came into the hall in the shape of Utherydes Wayn, her father's steward, and reluctantly she sent him to the maester first and her brother second, so the two of them might have some more time together.

Yet with the steward's arrival, Arya, too, had come back from their sweet little dream, and after a while she began to ask whose heads were mounted at the gates, how many men were in the camps outside and who commanded them. Gently, Catelyn told her, trying and failing not to mention a word of the war, or of Robb in the field, risking his life again and again. 

Then Arya fell back into silence for a while, bit her lip, and finally asked, \enquote{Why are all these men here? They should be somewhere else, fighting Lannisters, or protecting the land. Half of it is already burning, but there are still people out there. We've met one, an innkeep. He was nice. He gave us the horse you've seen outside, in exchange for Nymeria's meat.}

Catelyn wondered how often she could feel grateful to whatever god, whether old or new, had sent these wolves to her children. How often had they already saved their lives, and how many times were yet to come?

But Arya's question had pierced a wall inside her, and at last she told her bluntly what was happening.

\enquote{Lord Tywin is moving west, towards Robb, Arya. Edmure wants to offer him battle at the Red Fork and through him back to Harrenhal, where Roose Bolton will be waiting.} \thought{So he might gain some glory for himself, and his men forget the disaster of his last battle, and the siege of this very castle.} \enquote{They're here to protect Robb. I spoke with him about his plans just an hour before you arrived.} \thought{All I can do now is to pray, to all the Seven for his plans to work.} Maybe she would pay the godswood a visit, too.

Arya bit her lip again. \enquote{Could I see these plans?}

\thought{Those of the battles?} Her first thought was \thought{No, she just came back from war, she shouldn't think about it, not now. Give her a little rest, at least.} Yet on the other hand, Catelyn knew her daughter would think of it even more if she forbade it. Arya had always done what she wanted; Catelyn had no doubt she would search for even the tiniest hint to find out what was really going on. And that most likely she'd find some unsettling rumour or other that would only serve to worry her more, to make her more afraid than she already was.

\thought{I don't have to point out how insecure I'm myself. All the bannermen think these plans to be wonderful, so why shouldn't she as well? Give her some hope.}

Hope. Yes, Catelyn wished she could have more hope as well, with the host of fears in her mind.

\enquote{I'll show you. Later, first, we'll have to find you some proper clothes.}

Noticing her daughters look, she quickly added: \enquote{Or at least some without holes in them.}






\chapter*{Arya}

\chbegin{H}{er first thought upon seeing the map} had been of the dirty ground in the broken tower, back in Winterfell, where she'd so often played at strategy with Jon. Of course, this map was beautifully painted on parchment -- it was, in fact, the largest piece of parchment that Arya had ever seen -- and instead of little stones someone had placed little wooden figures on it, carved in the likeness of wolves and lions and stags. If not for her mother's grave expression, she could've almost believed that someone had played a similar game here, her uncle maybe.

Jon had told her that these figures existed, of course, but she'd never seen them -- after she'd never found them anywhere she'd come to suspect Maester Luwin always had them locked away somewhere. Still, Jon had told her quite a lot about them and everything else he himself had been taught in his lessons, along with Robb.

Now, Arya tried to remember it, all of it. It wasn't that she hadn't listened to Jon -- more the opposite, most of it she'd thought terribly interesting -- but then she'd never needed it, and there hadn't been much cause to remember it, in the last few weeks.

And it wasn't like she'd had a lot of time to think since she'd arrived. Riverrun must be a nice castle, she supposed -- and the Great Hall had been quite impressive, from what little she'd seen while wolving down whatever had been placed in front of her -- but she'd been so busy, even after she'd dealt with her hunger, first with being stuffed into a bath, then Maester Vyman having a look at the scars and wounds she'd acquired in the last fortnight -- scars she hadn't really noticed before, to tell the truth -- and getting new clothes to replace the rags she'd worn before. Over all that, she hadn't really had a chance to look around her, much less to think about what Jon had taught her, back at Winterfell.

Still, she remembered how basic strategy on a map worked, with all its wooden pieces. They'd discussed that often enough, in their endless arguments whether Daeron the Young Dragon or Nymeria of the Rhoynar had been better. Jon had always argued for Daeron, but she'd never understood what was supposedly so great about him; Nymeria had conquered Dorne, too, after all, and she hadn't lost it again within a \emph{week}.

Of course her lady mother didn't know about all that, which resulted in Arya now being giving an incredibly long-winded lecture about the subject.

\thought{The fish about Riverrun stands for the men we've seen outside, the lion at Harrenhal's probably Lord Tywin, the one in the Riverlands are his men, the wolves in the west Robb and his men, and so on. Why does she think I can't figure that out myself? It's obvious.}

She didn't say anything though, not after noticing the look on Gendry's face. He'd likely never seen a map before -- and she wasn't sure how much he knew about sigils, either, so he could probably use the introduction, though Arya didn't exactly think her mother did it for him. After all, it had been enough work getting her to allow Gendry in here already.

To be sure, she wasn't even certain if Gendry was in interested in the slightest, but otherwise he'd been all alone, and … they'd been together now for so long, just the two of them -- and Hot Pie and Weasel, of course, but they didn't really count, since they'd never really spoken with her -- she wasn't sure yet if she could stand to be separated from him for long.

That was hard to admit, even to herself, so she quickly let her thoughts return to the map, and the little pieces on it.

\thought{Hopefully she'll be true to her word and explain me all the plans as well, not just that a fish means \enquote{Tully men}.}

Although, now that she thought about it, the most surprising thing in that rooms wasn't she herself, the map, or even that Gendry was there when he couldn't even read, but that her \emph{mother} was there.

Arya hadn't even \emph{suspected} that her mother knew anything about strategy and battles. Why would she? Fighting and wars were \emph{unladylike}, as Septa Mordane liked to put it. Or rather, shout at her whenever she'd sneaked away from her lessons to watch her brothers' training in the yard.

\thought{And all the while she knew as much about it as Jon, if not more.}

Of course, there were some drawbacks, too.

Arya had not minded to leave her old, worn rags behind, but she would have preferred something more practical than the gown they'd given her. But Lady Catelyn was nothing if not crafty with getting what she wanted, and after telling Arya she wouldn't see the map in breeches, the gown was finally put on -- if reluctantly.

It wasn't just that she didn't like it. Now, every time she heard something louder than someone's voice, she spun around to see what it was, and she constantly had to think of how hard it was to fight in a dress, or how hard to run, especially when it came to running \emph{fast}. Arya felt like a cripple, unable to move as quickly as she would've liked.

Then she always had to think of Bran, and that truly she didn't have it so bad, she wasn't on the road anymore, after all.

\thought{If I could just remember that no Lannister soldier is likely to come and jump at me here.}

At least she still had Needle, but only after she'd threatened to find some longsword if anyone would try to take it away. Now she even had a nice little scabbard for it -- though not nearly as nice as the sword Jon had made her -- though she suspected she'd been given it more to protect her dress than for her herself.

She also had shoes.

That had come a bit unexpected. Since the Gods Eye she hadn't had any, and with time she almost forgot about them. Having her feet in them again felt somehow \emph{weird}, rubbing in unexpected places, the feeling almost entirely unfamiliar.

She wondered why that was. Before acquiring Fatigue, she hadn't ridden for more than a month and been fine.

\thought{I just hope someone thought to give her a place in the stables.}

There hadn't been time for her to check, not yet, anyways.

Then, with her mother finally arriving at the more interesting aspects of her speech, she stopped thinking about any of it. The tales her mother had told her before, in the hall, had been nice enough, but in a way, she suspected, they were as real as some of Old Nan's stories.

That was something else Jon had told her, once. \thought{Don't listen to rumours. That'll do more harm than good, or so Maester Luwin says, anyways.}

\enquote{That one's the Greatjon, there at Castamere, plundering what Lord Tywin left of its mines. Robb's on his way to the Crag, the seat of house Westerling.}, her mother said now, pointing to the two wolves in the west.

Arya wondered if either Septa Mordane or Maester Luwin had ever mentioned a House Westerling in their lessons, and who exactly the Greatjon might be. She wondered for a moment whether Jon would know.

\enquote{This one's Lord Tywin, here.} She was pointing at the lion in the Riverlands, roughly south of Riverrun, Arya saw. Well, she'd already known where he was. \thought{Right inside my Uncle's lands. No wonder he has all these knights here to throw him out.}

\enquote{Here is Lord Edmure and the men you've seen outside in the camps. He means to close the Red Fork and prevent Lord Tywin from crossing it.}

Which would … \enquote{Wait, what? Lord Tywin is just running \emph{out} of his lands, and he means to keep him back \emph{inside}? That's stupid.}

For a moment, her mother looked unsure, as if she wasn't quite convinced of it herself. Then she said, in what wasn't her most firm of voices:

\enquote{He wants to protect your brother.}

\enquote{Hasn't Robb got his own army? And even if not, can Uncle Edmure win? Everyone seems to fear Lord Tywin for some reason, and -}

She'd meant to say \thought{I heard Riverrun might be under siege again soon}, which was what the innkeep had said, before her mother cut her off.

\enquote{his last battle ended in a disaster, yes.}

\enquote{Oh}, Arya said, \enquote{I didn't even know he ever fought in one. What happened?}

\enquote{He offered battle to Jaime Lannister, was defeated and the castle was under siege when we arrived here. Robb defeated the Kingslayer, though - }

\enquote{And took him captive.}

\enquote{Yes. After that, his men started to call him \emph{the Young Wolf}.}

Arya bit her lip. For just a moment, she was reminded of her arguing with Jon, about the Young Dragon. \thought{I hope he'll die old and happy and in Winterfell, not like Daeron did, in a bed of scorpions}, she thought, though she wouldn't say it.

\enquote{I \emph{know} that, mother, we've heard that on the road, even before Yoren was killed. Though we also heard that Robb can't be killed, that he has an army of wolves, is feasting on Lannisters … All kinds of things, really.}

\thought{Don't trust rumours}, Jon said in her head.

\enquote{Part of it doesn't sound strange, though, does it?}, Gendry said now, for the first time raising his voice, \enquote{You said he had a wolf like you do, and yours has got quite a pack with it.}

Her mother gave him a somewhat shocked look, as if she was about to say \emph{how dare you interrupt my daughter.}

\enquote{Just, I thought the part with the army of wolves might be true, is all m'lady.}

\thought{Maybe he's right. If Robb has a pack of wolves, too, maybe …}
\enquote{I'm not sure}, she said, \enquote{We know they kill men. But I don't believe they eat them, too. I mean, I heard the tales and all, but …}

\enquote{We know they kill men? I've never seem them kill a man, have you?}

\thought{How is it he didn't notice?}
\enquote{You're stupid. Of course they kill men. What did you think, why we never met anyone after Nymeria came back?} Deciding to ignore her mother when she gave Arya a look as if she'd just admitted to eating menflesh herself, she went on \enquote{Anyway, they all say Robb's quite good at making battle plans. He probably doesn't need any rescuing.}

\enquote{Maybe}, her mother allowed.

\enquote{So one of the worst battle commander who ever lived wants to protect one of the best from getting killed?} \thought{That doesn't make any sense at all.}

When her mother started to look doubtful, she added \enquote{I mean, Robb \emph{must} have known that Lord Tywin would come for him sooner or later, with him near Casterly Rock. What would Robb do if someone besieged Winterfell, if not the same? And if he needed Edmure to help him, he would have told him before or sent a message. But he didn't, did he?}

She remembered how she'd talked with Jon about this for hours, that one could not afford to loose his seat while at war. \thought{When you loose your home, the men stop believing in you, they stop fighting in you, and you'll loose.} Most of the time, they'd ended their games with attacking the other's home.

\enquote{Not that I knew of, no. But a raven can get lost, a rider captured and questioned … Though I suppose he would send more than one of them, or more than one raven, so that at least one of them would come through.}

\enquote{But then … It doesn't make any sense at all. Robb \emph{wants} Lord Tywin to come back, he's not stupid, he wouldn't just do something an \emph{not} think ahead.}

Robb had always been thinking ahead, she remembered. Once, when she'd asked him to spar with her, or maybe even teach her, he'd said -- in a very genuine tone -- that he would gladly do so but didn't want to get her into trouble. And while she'd been angry with him for a week after that Arya couldn't deny that Robb \emph{did} think about what he was doing.

\enquote{You're right, Arry. He set up a trap, and they're just closing it before he's inside.}

\thought{Arry? Why's he calling me Arry?} For a moment she looked at Gendry, confused, though she tried not to show it.

\enquote{Yes. And Gendry, I think my mother knows that I'm a girl.}

\enquote{What? Oh, right, er … forgive me, m'lady}, he said, the first time addressing her mother directly, then turning back to her,\enquote{So you think he shouldn't close the River, Arya?}

She thought about it. Maybe it wasn't too bad a plan, even if Robb hadn't thought of it …
\thought{If only Jon was here}, she thought. Jon had always been better at their games, and she suspected that he would be better at this as well.

But of course he wasn't, and all Arya had now were memories of him. Still, she remembered all he'd told her, or near enough, every little war they'd fought. Once, when it had rained for days, they'd played through the whole of Aegon's Conquest and Roberts Rebellion, and almost all the battles had turned out right. And once they'd been through with them they'd started again, only this time with little changes, with different decisions, had tried to guess if Brandon Snow could have really killed the dragons, and what would have happened if he truly had, or if Argallic the Arrogant had won against Orys Baratheon, if the Dornish hadn't deserted their castles and offered battle.

But this here was a game much more serious, and much more deadly.

\thought{What can I do?}, she wondered desperately, \thought{How do you plan a war?}

There was only one thing she could think of. She would just try every strategy and every possible outcome, and see which one was most likely to win. She'd done that, sometimes, with Jon, and with it, she'd seemed to be at least a \emph{little} more successful.

\enquote{We'll just try everything and see what might happen. So, if we close of the Red Fork - } she moved the fish away from Riverrun and placed it on the river \enquote{ - we'll either win against Lord Tywin, or he'll loose. If we loose, it doesn't gain us anything, but we've lost some men. If we win, he'll loose a part of his army, and the rest will retreat to - to Harrenhal I think.} \thought{Or south, to Kings Landing, or maybe even north, or somewhere else entirely.} Even after one move, the possibilities started to add up and branch out, the way a tree had only one trunk but hundreds of leaves. \thought{This is going to take some time.}

Luckily, her mother made it easier for her.

\enquote{No, Arya. Edmure has commanded Roose Bolton to take Harrenhal. There aren't much men there, Lord Bolton is certain Harrenhal will fall within the week}, she corrected Arya.

Arya bit her lip. \thought{Then where else?}
\enquote{So if he can't go back, he could go north, but that wouldn't gain him anything. There's just another river there, and then the sea, or the Neck.}

\enquote{Yes.}

\enquote{Which means he'll have to go south.} She moved Lord Tywin's lion south until it reached the Blackwater, and noticed the rose there.

\enquote{A rose. Who's that?}

\enquote{Tyrell, I'd think. Ser Loras has three roses as his sigil, or at least he wanted roses all over the armour he ordered at the forge.}, Gendry said.

\thought{Why does he know more sigils than I do?}
\enquote{And they fight for … whom? Renly? Stannis?}

\enquote{Not Renly}, her mother told them, her voice as low as if she was attending some funeral, \enquote{Renly was murdered while I was there to treat with him. They … they might think it was Stannis who killed him, since he was preparing for battle against him shortly before Renly died.}

Arya thought there was something her mother tried to hide from her. \thought{They might think mother killed him. What a stupid idea.}
Still, lots of people had lots of stupid ideas, she'd found.

\enquote{Which means they'll either fight for Joffrey or just go home, or maybe even declare their own kingdom, like Robb did. But -- }
\thought{Never risk too much, Arya}, she could hear Jon in her mind, laughing, after he'd won once again.
\enquote{ -- we shouldn't assume we're lucky.}

Arya hoped she wouldn't forget anything. \thought{If we close of the Red Fork, Lord Tywin will go south, maybe join with the Tyrells, and then …} Who else was down there?

\enquote{Who are those stags down here? The one at Storm's End, at Dragonstone and here in the sea?}

\thought{They can't all be Joffrey's, can they?}

\enquote{These are Stannis' forces.}

Relieved, Arya said: \enquote{He's got quite a lot of them.}

\enquote{Yes, and we think he'll lay siege to King's Landing soon.}

\enquote{Where's that, m'lady?}, Gendry suddenly interjected. One look from her mother, and he fell silent again, regret and something vaguely like shame on his face.

\enquote{You can't read?}, her mother asked him, incredulously. Only then did Arya remember it herself, wondering why she hadn't thought of it before. \thought{He must have remembered every name my mother and I mentioned in the whole conversation.} She wondered how he'd managed it. She was scarcely able to keep everything in her own head, and she didn't have to remember every town's name as well.

\enquote{No, m'lady}

\enquote{Here, Gendry.}, Arya pointed at it. \enquote{Do we know when he'll attack?}

\enquote{No. Though he might be marching as we speak, and arrive there in a week. Two at most.}

Her head was aching from all the possibilities that added, so she just said them aloud. Maybe that would help.

\enquote{Ahh … So if we close the Red Fork, Lord Tywin will go south, join with the Rose here if we have bad luck, and then … He could either try to go to the west again, or he'll defend King's Landing if Stannis attacks it. I'd say that makes more sense, for him. If he goes west, King's Landing will be missing some protection … maybe Joffrey would be killed, so he won't do that, probably. But if we let him pass by, he might run into Robb's trap, and only the Tyrells will be close enough to defend King's Landing when Stannis arrives, so he might kill all of them for us, right?}

\enquote{Yes …}, her mother said, sounding only half-convinced, and then the question came she'd dreaded all the time.
\enquote{Arya? How is it that you know anything about strategy and battles? Has Maester Luwin given you some secret lessons I don't know about? I specifically forbade him to teach you anything about it.}

\thought{What am I supposed to say now?}

At last, she managed a \enquote{You did}, so that at least she wouldn't blame Maester Luwin, who'd always been kind to her. And sometimes he \emph{had} taught her things she probably wasn't exactly meant to know, but he'd never disregarded one of her mother's orders. Mostly, he'd taught about how the Wildlings probably lived. She'd always found that terribly exciting, and it was part of why she'd known enough to survive on the road.

\enquote{So how -- }

She did not like to tell her, but what choice was there? She'd guess it anyways, sooner or later.
\enquote{Because I have a brother who taught me everything I wanted to knew about it.}

A long pause, then --

\enquote{Robb?}

\enquote{I've got other brothers beside him}, she snapped, more angry than before.
\thought{Why can't she ever accept that not all my brothers are also her sons?}

\enquote{Jon Snow?}

\enquote{Yes. And don't be mad at him, he saved my life with everything he taught me more than once by now.}

It had sounded like a good thing to say, at least in her head, but Arya quickly came to regret it.

\enquote{That sword? Is that from him, too?}

Arya hesitated a moment, before saying \enquote{Yes.}, then quickly adding, {Don't look at me as if it was a bad thing. I'd be dead if not for Needle. Well, and for Syrio. Father paid him to teach me how to use it. You see? Even \emph{Father} didn't think I shouldn't ever touch a sword at all, so why do you?}

It was as if from all that, only one word had found its was into her mother's mind.

\enquote{\emph{Needle?}}

\thought{Oh, gods, that name …}

\enquote{Well, you were always complaining that I didn't know how to use these stupid sewing needles, so when Jon gave me this sword, well … I thought … I've got my own needle, now, and I'm much better with this one.}

\enquote{It's true, m'lady. She saved my life with it.}, Gendry sprang to her defence. Or, at least, he tried to. From the look on her mother's face she already knew it hadn't worked, but that was scarcely his fault. Gendry didn't know her mother, after all.

\enquote{\emph{Arya!} Is he saying that you -- }

\thought{Oh, I'll just tell her everything, maybe then she'll be quiet, at least.}
\enquote{Oh, yes, mother, he is saying that I stabbed someone. Don't be so horrible about it. We'd both be dead if I hadn't. Or he'd be dead and I would still be in King's Landing as Joffrey's little \emph{toy}. Now, could you please do all the shouting later and tell your brother he's too stupid to lead an army?}

\thought{That'll be an interesting conversation. I haven't even met him yet.}



\chapter*{Gendry}

\chbegin{T}{he room he shared with Kevan and Koval}, the other apprentice smiths, might have been small but Gendry loved it nonetheless. He couldn't even put his finger on \emph{why}, but he enjoyed every bit of it. The little chest for their belongings where he'd placed his helmet, the table for them to sit together and talk, even the bare walls and the straw of the single bed they all shared.

\thought{Maybe it's just being inside again.}

That was his best guess, at least, and he suspected he might be right with that. For all that he hadn't really minded sleeping outside, Gendry \emph{had} lived in a city almost his whole life, and even when he'd lived on the streets there had always been a stable or just an overhanging roof to shelter him.

Maybe that was it.

He didn't really know, and he tried to not particularly care.

The room was nice enough, and it was dry; that was all that really counted, except maybe that he was now a smith's apprentice once more, to Master Rymond this time. His first day of work would be waiting for him tomorrow, a day of mending armour and sharpening swords.

That should be nice, he thought, to be in a forge again, even if was just to sharpen swords. But that was only tomorrow; today had already happened quite enough, if one would've asked him -- not that anyone did. After arriving some steward or other had asked if he had a trade, had assigned him to Master Rymond and shown him this room. Gendry would have been happy to just fall into the bed then and there, but after that there had been Arya discussing battle plans -- why she'd asked for him to attend was beyond him -- then a conversation with her mother he rather wished he hadn't had, \emph{then} there had been an angry Ser Edmure, angry at being proven wrong -- though thankfully, by then Lady Stark had already dismissed him, and he'd only seen him, with his anger written so clearly on his face that even Gendry had been able to read it, in the corridor.

Part of him wished for this day to just \emph{end}, to hope that when he woke up the next morning it would be to shouting on the streets in King's Landing, or at least to shouting in the courtyard of Riverrun with a day of work ahead, a day without angry lords and ladies.

And another part of him insisted that he shouldn't go to sleep just yet, that there was still something missing …

\thought{Or has she forgotten already?}

Anyways, it wasn't like he could just go to sleep; that, he felt, would be tremendously insulting to Kevan and Koval, both of whom he'd only seen for a few moments, and who still were downstairs, in the forge with their father.

Gendry had never been one for socialising, but even he knew that it wouldn't do to just ignore the people who'd taken him in, even if it was on the Lord's orders.

And of course, there was still something missing …

He only really realized what it was when a boy knocked on the door and told him that \enquote{the Lady Arya requests your presence}.

For half a second he wondered if it was a request he could deny, but then again, he didn't really want to miss a chance to see his friend.

It wasn't like there would be a lot of opportunities for seeing her in the next few days, after all, or maybe forever.

Arya's -- he had, after all, promised not to call her \emph{lady} when no one else was present, and he dearly hoped that no one except him was present in his mind, no matter how her mother's looks made him feel as if she \emph{was} there -- Arya's rooms were lavish, a great chamber high up the triangular keep with a phenomenal view  downriver, the walls covered with fancy paintings of long-dead knights and kings and ladies. He didn't see any sign of a bed, but there was a doorway on one side, and he concluded that her bed must be behind.

Quietly, he marveled on the luxury of having more than one room; not even Master Mott had been able to afford that, and he'd been the richest and most successful smith in all of King's Landing.

\thought{And all that for the young daughter}. Gendry couldn't even begin to imagine how the Lord's chambers must look like.

Suddenly he was glad of his own small chamber with bare walls; maybe he had to share it with two other boys, but if he'd lived in \emph{this}, he'd have only thought of his father, and how he didn't want to become like him, all fat and useless.

Arya sat behind a table in the chamber's far end, with a glass in her hand and some elaborately worked sort of bottle in front of her. She looked up when he came in, and after a moment gestured for him to sit across the table.

\thought{And I'd though it was awkward, that one time a customer brought his daughter with him to the forge.}

Coming closer, he saw the liquid in her glass looked like wine. When he finally reached his chair and sat down he almost stumbled over his own foot. Why was he even here, in these rich rooms?

\thought{What happened to the little girl who happily drank her ale faster then me?}

Finally, she broke the painful silence.

\enquote{Would you like some?}, he voice came, and it sounded so reserved and formal that Gendry had to shiver; He \emph{had} expected for her family to maybe throw him out of the castle, but he'd never dreamt Arya herself might ignore their friendship so readily.

\thought{Calm down, Gendry}, he told himself, \thought{No one's throwing you out just yet, you're just seeing this in your head, they've even given you a place to sleep at night, and work for the days}, but it didn't help.

\enquote{I - I've never drunken any wine before m' - …}

He cursed himself for almost saying \emph{m'lady}, though without it, somehow the sentence felt even more out of place.

\enquote{Oh, come on, Gendry. I insist.}

In a way, her using his name made it even harder for him to hear. Arya took the fancy bottle-like thing and poured some of the wine into a glass, which she then placed before him. Slowly, very slowly, wondering what exactly had happened and \emph{isn't Arya a bit young for drinking wine} he took the glass, held it to his lips and took a sip.

He nearly chocked on it; the stuff was \emph{sour} and not at all what he'd expected or had imagined it. Involuntarily he spit half of it out, thinking that he was now most certainly doomed; he was sure that no one was supposed to spit the wine out.

Then, suddenly, the ice broke, and Arya was \emph{laughing}, inexplicably, and soon he was laughing to, while Arya said something like \enquote{You really thought I was serious?}.

After they'd both calmed down enough to actually speak again, she continued.

\enquote{I'm not even allowed to drink wine. These are the guest's quarters, someone must have forgotten it here, some time ago … I think it went sour already. Anyways, I just kind of had to, you know -- }

\enquote{You mean, you set this all up? Requesting my presence, the wine, that fancy bottle, the glasses …}

\enquote{Ah, sorry about Tom. I told him to ask you if you wanted to come, I wasn't really sure if you would, you know, after everything today, but … well, just know you can always refuse these calls, too, at least if they're from me, and when there isn't one, you can just come here anyways, I've told the guards to let you in. But yeah, I did the rest. Playing the lady, too. Do you know how hard it is to hold your face straight no matter what happens? I swear it's harder than hunting, I've got no idea how my sister ever managed it.}

For half a second a faraway look passed her face, but then it was gone again, and Gendry couldn't be sure if it had been there at all.

\enquote{You're good a' it, though. I never thought you might be tricking me.}

\enquote{Well, you're \emph{stupid}, then. I was on the brink of laughing the entire time. But anyways, I actually asked for you because I thought, well …}

But she didn't have to tell him; he already knew. Not long after, they were back to telling each other stories as they'd done every other night until now, first across the table, but at some point the moved to the floor, half-pretending that there was a campfire nearby. Later, Gendry could never be entirely sure whose idea that had been, and he liked to think that maybe they had just both thought of it at the same time.

Unlike the other times, thought, they both had new stories waiting to be told; Gendry about Master Rymond and his sons and the little chamber in which he'd sleep tonight, Arya about what else her mother had told her, and about how her uncle had reacted.

\enquote{You know, she actually sent me out of the room first. Said she feared Ser Edmure's reaction to me, and that there's no need for him to know just how much of … not a lady his niece is.}

There was something in her voice, something that he'd come to know during their previous trading of stories: she spoke in the same slightly-strained tone she always spoke of her status as a lady.

\enquote{Anyways, there was no one outside the door, so I just sneaked back there and listened. Mother didn't actually say that it was my plan, though. Still, Edmure shouted. \emph{A lot.} And mother shouted, too, at times, but I think Edmure agreed with her at the end.}

It was only late in the night that they both went to bed (they found that having candles nearby was supremely handy while telling stories after sundown), and the next day he'd likely fell asleep halfway during the day, but in that moment, he didn't at all care.

Over the next few days it started to feel more and more natural; he'd be working during the day, and no matter how tired he was, he'd always exchange at least one or two stories with Arya.

Around them, of course, life also resumed, with men riding out and upriver, demolishing the barricades that had already been built, with -- as Arya told him one evening -- Edmure making pointless (but harmless) battle plans so he wouldn't feel too useless, and with scouts searching for sign's of Lord Tywin's approach.

So it was that, only half a week after he'd arrived, though it felt much longer, Gendry stood with half the castle's population in the small sept, lighting a candle beneath the painted face of the Warrior, and the Crone. He'd never been the most godly sort of boy, or one to pray very often, but he felt it wouldn't go amiss.

This night, Lord Tywin would cross the Red Fork.

Maybe, later, Gendry would visit the godswood, too. He'd never been in one before, and didn't know what he might find there, but he figured that with Arya coming from the north it maybe would be more appropriate to pray to these old wooden Gods.

So he left the sept -- which truly was the only place of this castle that he could visit without being overwhelmed by its riches, after seeking shelter in Bealor's more than once when he'd been a boy on the streets -- with everyone else after the septon had finished his prayers, and slowly made his own way to the wood.

He didn't know what exactly he had expected, but he was quite certain that this wasn't it. Arya's stories had painted a wild place not unlike the woods they'd travelled through, overgrown with bushes that had been allowed to sprawl all over themselves, with a massive, ghastly white tree in its centre.

This here reminded him more of the gardens outside of the capital's walls, were tourneys were held and ladies could walk without getting any mud on their feet. The trees were neatly kept in check, the grass mown short with flowers in it, but not a single weed. There even were low walls in it, with carved statues on top of them.

Only in its middle could he get a glimpse at something that reminded him of Arya's tales: the tree might be carved and kept from sprawling out too far, but it was still a bony white with blood-red leaves. He'd never really understood why a face carved into a tree's trunk should make it a holy place, but the face, red and terrible as it was, certainly emanated a power quite on par with that of a septon's incense.

He found Arya kneeing in front of it, muttering under her breath.

\thought{She's praying}, he realized, and wondered why he was so surprised.

Respectfully, he kept his distance, as not to disturb her.

Eventually she rose; and when she turned around and saw him he could see a smile on her lips, though it looked forced. He wasn't a master face-reader, but even he could see the worry underneath her happy mask.

\enquote{Gendry}, she called for him, and soon he was trying to distract her.

Strolling through the garden together, Arya told him how insufficient this godswood felt, compared to that of Winterfell, and how the heart tree looked there, with a face weeping blood.

Gendry, who'd thought this one's face quite frightening enough for him was more than a bit disturbed by this, but he kept it quiet, and hoped she wouldn't notice.

By then the sun had already begun to set, and Arya was dragging him up to the battlements of the southern wall, to watch. Up there, it was colder than he would've liked, but they didn't have to wait for very long. Far in the south, just near enough that he could still see them, a thousand torches crawled across the land, a fiery procession of enemy soldiers.

\thought{When did I start picking sides in this war?}, he wondered, more than a bit surprised by his own thoughts.

But yes, now that he actually thought on it, these men down there, that were enemies, men who would've gladly killed him and Arya, and probably the rest of the castle's population, too, be they man or woman, knight or fleeing peasant.

He hated them; and suddenly he could understand why Arya's uncle wanted to stop them here. How could anyone allow them to move freely?

And others felt the same way, too, he noticed. They weren't the only ones who had come to watch, and in the other men's faces he could see blank hate, hate and disgust at the men who'd burned their land and property.

Suddenly, he had to remember the village where Lommy had died, and wondered if maybe it once was the home of one or two of the men who now stood with them, looking.

Had one of these men here sown the carrots that they'd plugged out of the ground? Had one of them tended to the chickens they'd found charred and burned?

Arya wasn't quiet about her feelings, either, and when finally they left while the worms of deadly people still crawled over the nearest ford -- he'd been told there were others further up the river, where undoubtedly just now even more men crossed the waters -- her face was the very image of uncertainty and doubt.

\enquote{What if I was wrong?}, she muttered, over and over again, and over and over again, he tried to reassure her that it wasn't possible, that there was nothing they could have missed.

He wished he himself could believe it.

After that night everything about the castle seemed to change; while nothing much looked any different -- it were the same walls imprinted with images of fish, the same buildings and the same anvils in the forge -- nothing was as it had been before. Everyone seemed strained, just on the brink of snapping and shouting, even Master Rymond, who had previously seemed as implacable as a rock.

Most importantly, Arya had changed. Maybe she hadn't been cheerful before, but now it was downright disturbing. Since the days on the road when she would speak nothing at all, shortly after Lommy had died, he'd kept an eye on her and on how much she ate, even now, when she was at the high table and he in the back of the hall. What he saw was disquieting. He tried to tell her as much during their daily storytellings, only for her to snap at him and to exclaim \enquote{not you, too! I'm \emph{fine!}}.

He could only suspect that her mother had already said the same, and that she hadn't succeeded, either.

Then, after three days of a restless, withdrawn Arya, when they were once more at trading tales -- which was hard, considering that she tried to hold back every word that might pass her lips, but still, she struggled through it -- she suddenly said, in that low, quite voice that he knew all too well but had wished he'd never have to hear again:

\enquote{I should be there.}

It took him a second to realize what she'd said. He'd just been halfway through recounting one of the tales they told about her brother, the Young Wolf, and his exploits in battle.

\enquote{I should be \emph{there}, Gendry, with him. If something goes wrong …}

Madly, he hoped this was some joke of hers, but of course it wasn't. The lighthearted girl who'd tricked him into drinking sour wine had gone days ago.

\enquote{I've got Nymeria and her wolves, I could help him.}

\thought{She can't be serious, can she?}, he thought, but her face told him otherwise.

\enquote{Listen, Arya. You've never been in a battle before, and neither have your wolves. You would only get yourself killed, and them as well.}

\enquote{I might have killed Robb already.}

He didn't know what to say to that, so he kept quiet.

\enquote{I know everyone says that there can't be anything wrong about my plan, but … they said that of Uncle Emdure's, too. What if he was right, and I was wrong?}

\enquote{You aren't wrong, Arya.}

A flicker of \emph{something} passed over her face, and Gendry dared to hope.

\enquote{I believe in you}, he added.

\enquote{That doesn't make it true. You know, on the road whenever you didn't know what to do you'd ask me. But I didn't know, either. I just guessed.}

He was about to say if that was so,then she must be very good at guessing, but she had already continued talking.

\enquote{I was just lucky. You all thought I knew what to do, I didn't. I \emph{didn't} know that the Kingsroad would be safe, I didn't know that Lommy and Hot Pie would survive that night in the village. I \emph{never} knew. I just guessed. And no one can always be right, with guessing.}

Again, he wanted to say that she hadn't \emph{guessed}, he'd been there, he'd seen and heard how she'd worked it out, but again she cut his thoughts off.

\enquote{You've got to help me.}

\enquote{What?}

\enquote{You have to help me. To get out. They won't let me out anymore, because I'm a lady and all, but I \emph{have} to.}

It took him a moment to understand what she was asking.

\thought{She wants me to smuggle her out of her uncle's castle, into a battle.}

\enquote{Your uncle would have my head}, he said, hoping she cared enough about him.

\enquote{He won't.}, she said, then took a piece of parchment and a quill, wrote something -- which he obviously couldn't read -- and laid it on her bed.

\enquote{I've written that he shouldn't blame anyone, especially not you. And I've asked mother to keep Edmure from doing anything stupid, and to get you someone to teach you how to read. See? He won't have your head.}

For a moment, she stopped, and then admitted \enquote{I would do it alone, but I can't. I went all around the castle today after noon, and there are guards everywhere, except in the part between the north gate and where the Tumblestone flows in. But I can't climb down there, and it's too high to jump. But there's a spare rope in the gatehouse, that no one will miss. I only need you to hold it while I climb down the wall.}

\enquote{This is mad}, he told her, because it definitely \emph{was} mad.

\enquote{You promised to get me out again, remember? I wouldn't even have come here, if not for you. \emph{Please}, Gendry, you promised.}

Gendry remembered that promise well enough, made in the early hours of the day they'd come to Riverrun. He'd hoped that she'd forgotten it.

\thought{I could break it}, he thought, \thought{she'd be safe, here, and I … well, I guess I would work at the forge.}

Their meetings would stop, though, he had no doubt of that, but if it meant that Arya wouldn't just run into danger …

\enquote{\emph{Please}, Gendry}, she was begging now, \enquote{you promised, and Father used to say that a promise was almost like a vow …}

But once she'd mentioned her father, he thought of his own, the fat and drunken king he'd been.

He'd sworn himself to be a better man.

\thought{And how would I be any better if I go and break the first promise I've ever made since then?}

Slowly, very slowly, Gendry made his head perform a nod.




\chapter*{Arya}

\chbegin{H}{er wolves ran all around her}, and with them came Arya's fears. Time and time again she urged Nymeria to go faster, but in the end it didn't help.

\thought{Of course it doesn't. You should've known that, too, you're not \emph{Sansa!}}

Through woods and forest, beneath trees and open sky they raced, hard on the heels of Tywin Lannister's army, racing to save Robb. And while they were fast, so much faster than on her previous journey, Arya felt as if everything was moving \emph{slower} than ever before.

The wolves would only travel at night, unless it wasn't possible otherwise, so they slept by day and moved at night, but in the dark everything looked the same to her, and nothing ever changed.

She knew it was an illusion, and that of course they were moving, but it still seemed that every night she slept under the same tree again and again, with Nymeria's warming presence beside her, comforting her in her doubts.

\thought{What if I'm too late, and Robb has already been killed? What if I find him save, only to discover that the Lannisters turned round and burned Riverrun instead? What if Mother's dead?}

And, at times,

\thought{What if \emph{I} die? Would anyone care, except for maybe Gendry?}

Perhaps someone \emph{would} care, she thought, but then it would probably only be because she'd run away again, and once she returned mother would be there to scold her on her behaviour, would say that it had been a mistake to allow her wearing a boy's clothes, even if it had just been one day …

Every time that dawn broke and she went to sleep she had to think of Gendry, and of them sharing stories. Some part of her hoped that he now told them all to Kevan and Koval, the smith's boys and other apprentices. He'd seemed happy to be with them, after all.

But of course, for the most part, she wished for him to be \emph{here}, with her. But of course that wouldn't work, not ever, not with him being so scared of Nymeria. And now the whole pack was around her, not hidden deep in the woods as it had been when they'd been on their way to Riverrun.

Truth be told, part of her was glad for him, that he didn't have to be with her, and part of her missed him so very much.

Most of the time, though, she tried not to think too much about him, for every time she did, she'd remember him standing there, high above her on Riverrun's battlements, holding the rope in his hands, with the shouting that had started behind him.

She'd run away from everything then, searching for her direwolf, but still she feared that everything there had gone horribly wrong. There was the letter, true, but …

\thought{What if they just ignore it? No one's ever really listened to me, after all.}

It was only two day later that she realized this wasn't entirely true, and that at least her mother \emph{had} listened, at least once.

\thought{Only then to lie about it to her brother, and claiming it was all her idea instead.}

If she'd had cared for jokes, maybe she would've laughed, then.

\thought{Family, duty, honour. Aren't that your words, mother?}

But she didn't laugh, the laughing girl was long gone, and so the days and nights passed by her in silence.

Sometimes they'd come across a village, or a small holdfast, but of course there was never anyone there, not in the dead of the night, and half the time the people had already fled anyways. Sometimes there were only smoking ruins left of where once there'd been houses.

Often, Arya felt like a ghost, hiding in the dark until its time -- and place -- were ready.

And sometimes her wolves would want to raid these villages and farms, and she had to hold them back. Nymeria commanded them, for the most part, and for the most part they obeyed her, too, but there were always some trying to get around it.

Then, once, Nymeria resisted for just the shortest of moments, after she'd made it clear she would have none of the raiding.

\thought{Don't you see that you're doing exactly what we're trying to stop!}, she wanted to scream at Nymeria, at all of them, but stopped short. She remembered that stupid story in an inn, so long ago, of a giant she-wolf stealing babies.

Finally the ground grew steeper, the hills taller, with the land taking on frightening shapes in the dark. Mountains loomed into the sky far away, like giants waiting for their pray. Around them the woods grew thicker and bizarrely liveless, the way woods do at mountainsides, with the trees looking scary and bony and old, like in one of Old Nan's tales.

She knew there weren't any weirwoods this far south growing wild, not anymore, but in the nights, on Nymeria's back, she could almost have sworn otherwise.

Sometimes, part of her expected to see a shadowcat running by, or maybe a bear, or a giant.

\thought{That's just stupid}, she scolded herself, \thought{giants don't exist, no more than grumkins and snarks.}

Part of her wondered why she felt so very much like Sansa.

When the hills finally grew to the size of mountains and they had to find passes and search for easier ways to climb, when sometimes the valleys became so tight that it there was a wall of stone on both sides and it became hard to find any food, at last they came in view of a castle.

A real, proper castle, not like the small holdfasts they'd come across before.

But this wasn't Winterfell, or Riverrun; Even if it had been the Red Keep she'd spied there, she thought it might've been more comforting. This building wasn't pretty, not even in the rough and grim way Winterfell had always been; this was a merciless heap of stone, a fortress standing on guard, with torches and men with arrows perpetually nocked above its high, foreboding walls.

If the mountains had seemed like giants, then she truly did not know what this thing was. They might've been much higher, but if anything that made them less scary; the way these towers loomed above her and her wolves was more than enough to frighten her well and truly.

This must be the Golden Tooth, she supposed, that tiny, seemingly inconsequential little dot that had been on the map back in Riverrun, grown large and lifelike and terrible.

She wondered why anyone would name it the \emph{Golden} Tooth. It was as golden as Ice had been, after they'd beheaded her father: not any particular colour, but with the look of death and dread about it.

And maybe this blade was already bloody, and her brother's dead, lifeless corpse was waiting for her behind it, held in its trap.

\emph{Behind it.}

She had to get behind it.

That really shouldn't be a problem, she thought, not one of these guards would be watching for wolves, much less a direwolf with a princess on its back …

… but still, she couldn't help it.

What if they saw her?

What if just one arrow was set loose on her? She'd seen the holes and dents a well-shot arrow would leave in a plate of armour; without it, there was no chance of surviving, surely.

Nymeria seemed to have no such qualms, though. Beneath her the direwolf did barely even slow down at all as this great fortress came into sight, seemed to barely spend a thought on it.

Arya very dearly wished she could be a wolf, too, then. Maybe then fear wouldn't grip her the way it did.

\thought{Don't be so absurd. Nothing's going to happen, just get on with it!}

If only that were as easy as it sounded in her head.

As they drew closer, slowly, terribly slowly, it felt as if something poured water over her back, and then over her head; finally, she realized it was her dread. Then she could start to feel herself sweating, while her clothes grew damp she could see her hands shaking madly in Nymeria's fur, who still trotted on as if nothing was amiss.

And of course there wasn't anything wrong, there \emph{wasn't}, no one was going to notice them, after all.

Still she felt like she'd felt fighting in the keep besides the Gods Eye, like she'd felt when she thought that Yoren was some thug who'd come to kill her.

When the castle was so close she could make out individual stones, and individual men through the dark she buried herself in Nymeria's fur, hiding and hoping that no one would notice her.

She could feel the the direwolf's muscles working, thundering across the ground, could \emph{hear} the others around her, and finally, madly, she slipped into the beast's mind.

Running and running, and then suddenly they were past, and not long afterwards Arya emerged again, sat up and looked ahead. Dawn had just begun to break, just enough for her to make out an enormous valley, and like a scar there were the signs of an army having passed through in the green grass.

Her clothes were soaked, soaked from her own sweat, but she didn't care.

\thought{We're hunting Lord Tywing into his own lands}, she thought.





\chapter*{Catelyn}


\chbegin{I}{t was always as dark as in the dead of the night in Riverrun's cells}, and the walls seemed to drink what little light her candle provided her with. Catelyn found it hard to find her way to the bastard's cell, and if not for Brienne's steady and sure presence beside her, she might have gone astray already.

Her days had grown darker again, seeming even worse than they had before. In the very moment she'd seen Arya standing there in the courtyard she'd felt hope again, a feeling that had almost been lost to her. But then over the next few days it had grown; Arya might be difficult, and it might be hard for both of them to adapt, but she'd believed all that would come in time.

Oh, how na\"ive she'd been.

Oh, how cruelly that spark had found itself crushed, crushed beneath a thin, inconsequentially-looking sheet of paper, but a piece of paper that made her feel the cold of winter as if it had been the Wall itself.

With it, darkness had fallen again, and her hopes as well. In hindsight, she supposed she really should have known the happiness would not last forever.

It never had; not with Brandon, not with Ned, not even with her father, who'd used to joke he'd outlive them all.

That did not change the shock she'd felt when Utherydes Wayn had come running, to tell her that they'd captured her daughter's bastard friend lowering someone over the castle's walls.

Of course, Arya had always befriended just about everyone; she knew the name of every servant in the castle as well as Catelyn herself, and with most of them she'd been friends as well, not to mention countless playmates of dubious birth and standing she'd met in the winter town.

Still, Catelyn would have never suspected she'd be fooled by a Lannister spy. That had been the steward's theory, and eagerly she had adopted it. There had of course been a vague sense of danger -- a spy in Riverrun, and his messenger escaping was nothing to be taken lightly, and of course Edmure had had Gendry incarcerated immediately -- but still she'd slept comfortable that night, or at least more so than in the one that was to follow it.

For when the sun rose Arya did not attend the usual morning meal -- which was nothing too unusual, as she had often preferred just visiting the kitchen and bullying the servants into giving her something. In fact, she hadn't done it since returning to her, and in a weird inversion of her usual reaction to it Catelyn had in fact been almost happy noticing it, happy that the old Arya was slowly returning to her.

That was, until she later entered her daughter's chambers -- even if she was secretly happy about her spirit resurfacing, that did not mean she could get away with it unchastened -- and found the letter lying on the table by her bedside.

Somehow, she hadn't even had to read it, hadn't \emph{wanted} to read it, and yet her shaking hands had takenit as if they had their own will.

\thought{Mother}, it had run, \thought{I'm sorry I'm gone again. But I have to go and save Robb, and Sansa too. I can't loose them. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. Nymeria will help me.}

Dimly, she'd wondered how often she herself had wanted to do the same. How often had she dreamt of placing her hands around Cersei's throat? Around Lord Tywin's?

Not so long ago, when she'd watched his army cross the river had she wished to force them to a halt, had suddenly understood her little brother so very well …

That one line would have been enough to shatter her.

But of course it didn't end there.

\thought{If you want to blame my missing on someone, blame me. I might end up requiring Gendry to get out of the castle, but just know that neither he nor anyone else forced me to do this. Trust me, he could not fake this, he cannot even read, much less write.}

Of course she'd known that; she'd heard him admit it, after all, in that room during their fateful conversation.

Still, she felt that she had failed. Mere moments after Arya was gone, even before her absence had been noted, the bastard had found himself in a cell as deep beneath the castle as one could build a shaft on an island without water breaking through. In fact the very walls around here were dripping wet, the ground muddy.

Somewhere a distant part of her thought that in a way these were great news; after all, there'd never been a spy then, and no information passed on to Lord Tywin.

If only she could think about that, then maybe she would stop wondering why Arya had willingly chosen to go. Numbly, she remembered Renly's summer knights. Her daughter had seen more of the true shape of the world than all of them together; surely there had to be a good reason for what she'd done.

But then, Catelyn was well acquainted with the power that doubt could hold in a person's mind.

\thought{If you can, try to get Uncle Edmure make the Maester -- Vyman, I think his name is -- teach him something, how to read and write at least. I should guess there's a knight's education in there for saving a princess?}

That passage had baffled her the most. Arya had never once referred to herself as princess before, not even as a lady. She allowed others to call her that, but would always grumble at it, and had quickly made it clear to her maids and some of the stewards that they were to either call her by her name or not at all. And yet here she used her title, and in a way Catelyn had not yet expected from her. 

\thought{She's using it to give her words more weight.} There was something almost like cunning about it, something she hadn't expected at all from her. It was the kind of thing she would've put in a letter to someone whose reaction she wasn't sure about -- Lysa maybe, or Petyr. To see it directed at her, and from her own daughter …

Still, even if she wanted to, she couldn't grant that request. Edmure had thrown the boy in a cell, and then he'd rode of to close the Red Fork behind Lord Tywin, trying to keep his bannermen happy if nothing else. And even before that he'd refused to speak with her, ever since the day she'd told him of the plan's true origin.

Without him, there was little she could do about the boy's situation.

At least it had been relatively easy to get the guards to let her though, without her brother there.

Now, in the dim light of her lantern, surrounded by oppressing, damp walls she read the letter again, one last time before speaking with the bastard who'd done so much.

\thought{Sorry I'm leaving again, mother. But I have to go. Your daughter, Arya.}

When she'd first read it, the farewell had left her in tears, and with a burning anger for everyone who'd been responsible for planting this idea in her head. She had raged, she had screamed, and finally, she had wept.

Wept for her young girl, who had only just come back. Her stay had been so short, that she only afterwards realized that they had never really talked about what else would happen, what they'd do now. Catelyn had never even thought to tell her that she was betrothed, nor that Robb himself was. \thought{I only wanted to give her peace for a time. Why did the Gods had to take it all away again?} She'd spend hours in the little sept of Riverrun, and then again hours in the godswood, where she'd always been and would always remain a stranger, but she'd thought that maybe these old forest Gods might help Arya more, who'd always looked so much like her Ned. Yet for all her trying, she hadn't found an answer.

Finally, she'd visited her father again after that night, and told him everything that had occurred, but he couldn't offer her a solution, either. Catelyn couldn't even be sure if he'd still heard her.

So now she was here, on her way to the one person who might give her an answer. It shamed her to admit, but at times it had seemed as if he knew her daughter better than she herself did.

Edmure had blamed everything on him, had thrown him in a cell, and Catelyn thought she understood.

\thought{It's so much easier to find faults in others, while one is faced with his own mistakes and errors.}

It was all that her sweet brother could do to keep his men loyal, after the disaster that had been his battleplan, with its army already assembled, and now with loosing the sister of his king.

So Edmure -- that same man who'd let the smallfolk in, even though they'd only be useless mouths if it came to a siege -- had thrown the boy in the deepest hole he'd been able to find in the castle, for her son to punish him for his crime. She hadn't protested, had found it so terribly easy to blame the bastard when the only other to be blamed would be her daughter.

At least, until she remembered the stormlord's reaction to their King's death, and what had really happened in that dreadful night. She had taken his supposed murderess as her own sworn shield, as much to protect the girl as to protect herself, because she'd known her to be innocent.

How was this any different, when Arya herself had told her that Gendry was not to receive any blame?

Still, he \emph{had} lowered her from the battlements, she knew that for a fact.

There had to be some reason \emph{why}. There had to be.

\thought{I have to know. What has happened on that road, that she runs away from me again? That she runs into an open knife and rips all plans to pieces when she herself was the one to draw them?}

Again and again she'd searched for answers.

\thought{What happened on that road?}

So now here she stood, in front of a door that was so ancient that it didn't even have a proper lock, only a rusted metal bar halfway rusted through. The door itself was heavy old oak slowly rotting away in the dampness, and even for Catelyn it was easy to open. Inside it was no better. This was the bowels of Riverrun, and it certainly looked and smelled the part.

Inside, in the meagre shine of her candle she found the boy, lying nimbly in a corner, his arms and legs bound in iron shackles. She also found the source of the stench, where his own shit had started to gather beneath him. The chains prevented him from moving, so he had to lay on it.

\thought{As broken as that door might be, he cannot even move a foot.}

When she'd first seen him, he had been a young and handsome boy, even if starved from his journey and with mud on his face. Now, there was only a little shade of that left. His face was dirtier than she would have thought possible, yet when he raised it and looked at her, his eyes were the same piercing ice-blue they'd been before, though now they seemed clouded and darker.

\thought{More like Lord Renly's, now.}

She wondered if he'd meet with his death, too. It was, she thought more to distract herself, a good thing she'd left Brienne outside in the corridor, if one could call that ark earthy hole a corridor.

\enquote{Am I dead?}

Catelyn stayed silent. She did not know. Yet she had to give him an answer, for why else would he answer her questions in turn? It was not like she could give him anything that might help him in this position.

\enquote{That's for my son, King Robb, to decide. You will stay here until then.}

\enquote{Well, it's not like I'll be running of.}

He stopped there, but she knew what he'd left unspoken. \thought{Unlike your daughter.}

The boy stayed silent again, and Catelyn wondered what to do with him. \thought{If I ask him outright, he won't tell me anything. But then, how?} She wondered if she should have brought wine with her, to loosen his tongue.

\enquote{Arya said she'd leave a letter}, the boy told her. \thought{I know}, she thought, \thought{but I am at loss for what to do. Is that why I am here, because he knows so much about Arya that I don't?}

\enquote{Has anyone e'er read it? Or'd you burn it in one o' these great hearths you have up there? Must be nice and warm were you live, all nice and proper. Could do with a bit of warmth down 'ere.}

\enquote{I've read it.} \thought{try to get Uncle Edmure make the Maester -- Vyman, I think his name is -- teach him something}, the words came back, \thought{yet I didn't even do as much as open my mouth when he was thrown in here.}

\enquote{Why?}, she finally blurted out, unable to restrain herself any longer, \enquote{Why did you help her to get out? Why does the letter say you saved her life, when you admitted it was the other way round? Why did you ever come here in the first place?}

For a moment of complete silence, the boy stared at her with these icy eyes he had.

Then he started chuckling. It was a low sound, the laugh of a doomed man who knew his fate. She looked at him as she had used to look at Jon Snow, or Theon, whenever he had smiled, with the unspoken question of what he thought so funny.

\enquote{Why}, he laughed, \enquote{I'd ne'er thought I'd hear a highborn askin' me why, is all, m'lady} he paused a bit, then continued, \enquote{you highborns have ne'er cared about the likes o' me, so no one ever asks us \emph{why}. Other than Arya, that is. Is that answerin' your question?}

\enquote{No. That does not explain why you are here, and why Arya is not.}

\enquote{O' course it does. I'm here 'cause Arya helped me, an' she's not here 'cause she's carin' for others more than for herself.}

\enquote{You did not need to help her carry out her plans. Plans of young girls seldom succeed.} \thought{No matter how good their intentions.}

\enquote{Better than th' ones of certain lords, I've heard.}

He gave a laugh again. \thought{He's mad}, she thought, \thought{the loneliness in the cell has driven him mad.}

\enquote{I'd think that is quite another story.}

\enquote{Stories. Me and Arya, we used to tell each othe' stories, you know? M'lady. Well, le' me tell you one, then. You know, on that last day befo're we reached this castle. We'd been ridin' for ages, me in the back 'cause I'm no good with a horse, her in front with the reins, and then, su'enlly she turns us 'round, and proclaims she couldn't go to Riverrun after all, 'cause her sister was still in the city, you know, the one she's been complainin' 'bout all the time, that one. She said she'd hav' to do tha' now, then and there, 'cause once she'd here there wouldn't be no way out for her again. So I promised her, should she e'er need to get out, I'd help her … Might be you'd have ne'er even heard from her again, o'erwise. You're askin' why I didn't break my promise? Just bein' honest, I'd guess, always thought that's what's supposed t'be right. Look where it got me now, bein' honest and true. Arya told me you're caring much for honour up north, but I havn't noticed yet.}

What she heard made her innards turn to stone. What would Arya lead to that idea?

\enquote{\emph{Why? Why would she want to turn back?}}, she asked again, her voice cutting through the silence like a sword through the air.

\enquote{Why? Oh, I guess … I guess it was 'cause she thought you wouldn't want her anymore, wha' with all that blood on her pretty little girlish hands, that's why}, he said, in a pretend-casual tone, a mad laugh on his face, almost a sneer, as if he thought all this hilarious.

She thought the bastard continued to speak, but she didn't hear it. Fleeing out of the dungeon, past a bewildered Brienne, barely holding back her tears she made her way to her chambers before collapsing in a sobbing heap.

The words seemed to follow her, cruelly echoing in her mind.

\thought{She thought you wouldn't want her anymore.}

On her way she wondered if she was truly so bad a mother, but all thoughts were drowned by the booming echo.

\thought{She thought you wouldn't want her anymore.}



\chapter*{Arya}

\chbegin{B}{efore her, the great valley opened up}, an endless line of marvellous grass and trees, framed by giant mountains on either side. Arya thought the ones in the Vale of Arryn could not possibly be any higher, even though Maester Luwin had always said they were the tallest ones in all of Westeros. It was a truly remarkable sight, and if she'd cared to enjoy it, maybe she would have tried to climb one of these hills a bit north from her and climbed on a tree there. She would have left Nymeria on the ground, while she herself would climb on its branches, as good as Bran had ever done.

Yet Bran had fallen down, and Arya could not find enjoyment in the mountains' beauty. To her, they were like giant cliffs, like the walls of a great and monstrous prison where she'd been captured inside. The setting sun behind her had the color of blood, and the sky above an icy blue so hard and threatening she almost feared to look.

And of course, there was the gash, the crack that was before her, with the brown and black and mud of it in stark contrast to everything else. It was what an army left behind, an army on the march.

Arya found it hard to look at, but even harder to look at the lands surrounding it.

Instead, she often buried herself in Nymeria's furs again, and sometimes, she'd even slip inside her.

Then, she could forget to be afraid, then, when she was no little girl, but a giant wolf with an even larger pack of her little cousins with her. But Arya still found it difficult to control when these times where. She'd slip off into Nymeria in her sleep, or when she feared to look at the vastness of the army's path she was following, or when she just missed her home, her human pack. Sometimes she could control it, and few were the times when she couldn't slip into Nymeria when she didn't want to do it; more often, she found the it was more frequent that she had trouble finding her way \emph{back}.

Maybe it was because when she was Nymeria, her pack was \emph{right there}, and she was \emph{with them}, and neither she herself nor the anyone else needed to be afraid. But when she was Arya, she'd remember the look her mother always gave her when she was dirty, remembered Bran, sleeping, while she wondered if he'd ever open his eyes again, remembered Sansa screaming and crying as Joffrey called for her father's head. And she'd remember Gendry, and the cry she'd heard, running away from Riverrun's walls and the rope he'd lowered her with and into the woods.

\thought{Don't be afraid}, she told herself, \thought{Mother will help Gendry, and Nymeria will help you.}

Still, it was easier inside Nymeria, who had her whole pack all around her. Even then there were thoughts of her old pack, of Ghost and Shaggydog and Grey Wind, and even of Lady and the wolf whose name she'd never learnt, so very far away. But at least Nymeria had found a new pack, and though they might be smaller and weaker than her, they still gave comfort.

Comfort. Sometimes Arya wondered what exactly that was supposed to be.

Comfort and Peace. Such simple things, but she had trouble getting them into her head, now.

The one village they'd come across, that had seemed peaceful, she remembered. When they'd come through it, in the dead of the night, not a single soul had been there; not a single fire lit. How easy to think they were all asleep and at home, dreaming.

\thought{There're all off at war}, she'd thought, \thought{there're all out there to kill my brother.} And with that, the peace of that village had been broken, and the silence in it had assumed an eerie, terrible form of a threatening cry waiting to jump at her, as if the very houses, even the stones they'd been built of, where hissing at her, whispering threats of death and destruction.

She'd been glad to leave it behind after that.

The grass and trees weren't nice, either, and there was always the scar in the land that the army had left, but she couldn't hear the trees whispering.

\thought{Don't be \emph{stupid}! Trees don't talk, and neither do houses!}, she'd told herself more than once already, but she couldn't help it.

So instead she stared at the gap, whether through Nymeria's eyes or her own, and watched, and searched. Of course, there wasn't much to be missed even with just a casual glance at it, but she could pretend. Then, she could let her thoughts drift, to Jon at the Wall, who'd surely be tracking beast for supper or some such.

Then, she did not have to ponder on where it was that she was going, and on what she was going to do.

But now there was no turning away now anymore, for already she could smell it when she was Nymeria, could see the crows hanging in the sky even with her own eyes, like an army of flying demons following in the wake of the living one. 

It didn't take long for the smell to almost overwhelm her when she was a wolf, as if the stench was a rock pressing down on her.

\thought{Men-smell}, she knew them, \thought{of the men-pack that attacked my sister, and which has killed members of the girl-pups own pack. The smell of rotting, and of crows, circling and waiting to be fed.}

But most of all, it smelled like \emph{prey}, and she wanted to feed these crows hanging hungry in the sky.

At the Golden Tooth, Arya had been afraid of arrows from its high walls, but there was no such fear now.

\thought{They don't see me. They haven't even noticed my yet, though I've seen them for days.}

The wolves where so easy to overlook, and not one scout had ever noticed them.

\thought{Silent as a shadow. Fierce as a wolverine.}

Now was the time to strike. No one could harm her on her wolf's back, or in its mind, and no one would be able to fight them. Even though the sun was setting, they were still marching, and Jon had always said an army was most vulnerable when moving. Only a few trees where still left to hide them, only a bit of undergrowth, each little bush trampled by a thousand soldiers.

As Nymeria fastened her pace she could soon see the last few members of the Lannister army, just barely visible behind the trees. Around her, she could feel her wolves' growing excitement, their greed to kill.

Slipping half into Nymeria's mind, she thought \thought{kill them. Kill them all.}

And even before she could see the soldiers clearly, she could hear the screams, and see the wolves running all around her like an incoming flood.

Not soon after trumpets sounded, alarms, when the attack was noticed. They tried to rally, tried to defend themselves, but no one knew how to fight wolves gone rampant. Nymeria herself was soon the beating heart of the battle, ripping throats and scratching others so they'd bleed to death, pumping the men's blood out and onto the ground.

On top of her rode Arya, sword in hand, and half felt like an avenging god come to slay the demons. No matter if armoured or not, they fell beneath her blade, beneath Nymeria's claws, or in the mouths and claws of a hundred beasts come to kill them.

Not long after the butchering had started the crows had already come, and even while they lay alive picked out people's eyes and ripped the flesh from their bodies. While Nymeria and the others howled, Arya noticed she'd started sweating, only then to see that it wasn't sweat at all that she'd felt on her skin; instead, it was the blood dripping and flowing, but not her own.

There did not seem to be an end; two-legs all fell and fled under the force of the flood. Where in other battles men might have cried and screamed for their mothers, here, they were not even long enough alive for that. Whether armoured or not, with sword in hand or with food, on horseback or in the back on a wagon; none of it mattered to the wolves.

The noise  of the battle was drowning, pressuring, solid like a rock and steady as a mountain; soon, Arya barely heard it, while blood and entrails flew around her. If her goal had been to paint the world itself in red she'd have succeeded, if only for a moment. Later, she noticed that some of it -- whether blood or Lannister crimson she could not say -- were broken by gold and yellow and white, as some of the wagons had caught fire. Nymeria herself jumped on one, ripped the girl hidden there apart and threw the whole thing over in what was barely the blink of an eye. From time to time arrows flew into the chaos, but only seldom did they hit anything, and it didn't take long for the archers to either run or be run down.

And then, suddenly, there was silence. Some were moaning, or gasping in pain, but it was a deafening silence still, and for some time Arya couldn't hear a thing.

Where before there had been green and brown and mud, now everything was red or burning, crimson or gold, as if to herald the final resting place of the Lannisters. The wolves were all feasting; Nymeria, with Arya still slipped inside her, devoured half a man, then another, though she didn't eat much of him; he'd been wearing his armour. Inside her mind, Arya could taste it, taste the blood on her tongue, feel the bones shattering and splintering between her teeth.

It was only later, when the sun rose and Arya was back in her own head, that she saw the people lying dead, the women who'd been campfollowers and their children as well as the men, and realised what she'd done.

And then the silence was broken, by a cry of despair from her mouth.





\chapter*{Catelyn}

\chbegin{A}{ bastard and a king} faced each other in the little chamber behind her father's great hall, yet to her they both seemed so much like boys. Robb had returned only hours ago, and while he'd looked the part of the stern King in the North, but Catelyn had only been able to see the young boy, who'd foolishly broken his betrothal. Of course, word of that had come before, and by the time Robb himself had arrived in Riverrun the Freys had already been gone. Gendry, on the other hand, had spent weeks deep under Riverrun, and now looked as much like a boy as he'd seemed a man when she'd first seen him, when he'd seemed the image of Lord Renly, or a younger Robert.

Still, the air was hard as as a brick, and that had nothing to do with Edmure's barely averted foolishness or Robb loosing Walder Frey as an ally. Nor even with her own story of Stannis's victory over his brother, or with Stannis's apparent victory at King's Landing. As of now they had only heard rumours -- no raven had reached them yet, not from either side -- but it seemed that he'd taken the city, though right now Catelyn couldn't care less.

No, Instead, it had everything to do with her daughter. Catelyn had thought so much about her these last few days, somehow it felt that this was only the logical conclusion, or that maybe she was only dreaming this now while still sitting beside her dying father's bed, the Red Fork outside the window. \thought{Watch for me, little Cat}, he'd told her so long ago, \thought{Watch for me.}

\thought{Watch for me, mother}, she'd thought then, beside that window, had thought it in Arya's and Robb's voices. \thought{Watch for me.}

And she had watched, watched and waited for day after day, had looked out for them through that dusty old window above a dying man's bed.

And Robb, at least, had come back. But before that someone else had gone from her, forever.

\thought{He is my only son now}, she thought, \thought{I must be strong for him.}

Strong for him. Right now, facing the bastard, he might look as hard and unmovable as a block of pure and solid ice, and yet … there was something, something in his eyes, that betrayed his true emotions, his fury and his grief.

Of course, there was also the Lady Jeyne, now his wife and queen, and the story of how that had come to be. Though she suspected that only parts of his tale it were true it still stood witness to his own reaction upon receiving that raven.

\thought{Dark wings, dark words}. Never had the saying rung with more truth than it had at that dreadful day.

In a certain way she Catelyn couldn't really put her finger on it felt oddly appropriate that the bastard's hair was black. Ink-black. The black of a raven's feathers. He'd brought bad news to her, too, after all. For days she'd searched for some hidden meaning in what he'd said to her in that dungeon, some hidden message of her daughter's, but to no avail. However much she turned and twisted his words, she could not escape their meaning.

Catelyn had wondered whether or not she should tell her son of it. \thought{Maybe I should have. What will I do if the boys tells him? Claim that he is lying, even when it's true?} Robb would've probably believed her, but …

Yet with all her pondering she'd missed his actual arrival, and before she'd known it he'd been there demanding for his sister. No matter how much Edmure might want him to forget it or might wish that the rider from Ashemark had never reached him, it had.

\enquote{Mother, where's Arya? Has she fallen ill?}, he'd asked her, after Edmure failed to answer his demand. What had she been supposed to tell him, but for the truth?

He'd dismissed his men, ordering that only Edmure and she herself stay. In a curious way he'd seemed both boy and king then at the same time: his face as hard as Ned's had ever been, his voice as icy as the Wall itself, all while looking so much a boy desperate to see his family. Her brother had blamed it all on the boy, on Gendry, who'd quickly been summoned and now stood in the centre of the room, Robb in front of him. Both seemed curiously lost as for what to say. Gendry had knelt, probably because someone somewhere had told him to kneel in the presence of kings, and when nothing much happened he'd stood up again, and that had been it.

Finally, after seemingly eternal moments of quiet, Robb broke the silence.

\enquote{Where's my sister, boy?}

Again a thundering silence echoed in the room, with the air feeling dense enough to cut it.

\enquote{She won't die, I think}, the bastard finally said, \enquote{I'm not sure about her comin' back 'ere, though. At least not all to quickly. Might be on her way already, might be not. I don't know. She's your sister, not mine. Why do'ya have to ask me?}

Catelyn wondered what it said about her success of being a mother that she wasn't even sure whether or not Arya would \emph{want} to come back to her. For so long she'd been, but now …

She wondered what Robb thought. Would he blame it on her, would he say that she'd scared Arya away? Could she even fault him for it, if he did? Or did he think the same way as Arya apparently did, in some place he'd well-hidden from her, deep inside him?

And while she wondered, the silence stretched longer and longer, never broken. It was as if the whole of Riverrun was holding its breath, waiting for what would come next, no matter that no one except the four of them knew what this was about, and only a handful of others that they were even gathered here at all.

But still the silence was unbroken, while the room grew colder by the second. Somehow, her thoughts found a way to Jon Snow, the other bastard Arya was -- \thought{let it still be \emph{was}, and not \emph{had been}}, she prayed -- friends with, the one Ned had sent to the Wall, now a brother of the Night's Watch at Castle Black. She wondered if it could possibly be any colder there than it was in Riverrun's audience chamber right now.

Suddenly there were audible steps on the wooden floor outside, coming up to the door, and then a man burst into the room, not just shattering the silence but outright ignoring it in a way she hadn't thought possible at all.

Surprised and confused, she recognized him as Hermis Wort, one of the stewards.

\enquote{Your Grace, my lord, my lady} -- for a second he stopped there, as if wondering if the bastard had a title as well, or maybe wondering what exactly it was that he'd stumbled into here -- \enquote{I know this is a private meeting, and so does the steward, but … he thought you might want to know that …}

\enquote{What?} Robb snapped.

\enquote{There's -- there's a girl at the gate, claiming to be the Lady Arya. And though she looks like she'd lived in a forest for months, she's got the right look as well.}

Suddenly, Catelyn could feel her heart almost stop. Looking around, she could see relief in her brother's face, and doubt in her son's, but what interested her most was Gendry's. There was hope in it, of course, but also … confusion?

\enquote{Bring her here}, she told Hermis.




\chapter*{Arya}

% In general: little hints about her being "The Dragon" / "The Doctor" just sliding on the edge to madness

% First part: arriving in Riverrun, refelcting on what she's done: Sending Nymeria away, blaming it on her (Cat parallel), constantly feeling that nagging presence in the bakc of her mind; washing the blood of her, fear of not being accepted, believing she /shoudn't/ be accepted anymore

% Maybe Blackfish fetching her, cheerfully making jokes about her being like Catelyn, playing outside in the mud.

% Seeing Gendry and the injustice done to him, deciding that she might as well do something useful with her own "monsterness". Saving, but also ignoring him.

% Hearing of Bran/Rickon's "deaths"; enquiering about Stannis, wondering if it was worth it. At least Sansa might come home, she thought. She'll be a better daughter than I ever could

% Storming off into her room, holding back more violent thoughts/fears

% Argument with Gendry?



\chbegin{A}{rya felt as if she was moving backwards}, as if for every step she made towards the the great gate of Riverrun she made two away from it, back towards the red field of her memory. Of course she knew that was utter nonsense, and yet every few steps or so she turned her head back, just to make sure it really wasn't there any longer.

Though she hadn't really kept track of the time, Arya knew it must've been at least a week since that, and quite possibly more, but regardless of frequently she reminded herself of that, it still felt like only a second ago. So often had she tried to wash the blood off her, and by all rights she should be cleaner now that she'd ever been before in her life, but still she saw herself only in red, saw the dried blood in her clothing.

When the guard at the gate asked for her name she struggled for a moment to speak, and then struggled  a moment more for what words to say to him. He had armour on, too, and though there was a trout pictured on his chest and his coat blue instead of red she could still so easily picture him, lying there, with his throat lying in the mud, several paces away from the rest of his body.

\enquote{I'm Arya}, she finally managed.

His face showed confusion for a moment, which didn't really make things better. Confusion was too close to surprise, and surprise too close to fear.

\enquote{Princess Arya Stark, sister to the King of the North and the Trident?}

All she could do was to nod, while the man was grinning like a madman. Half of her feared that should she open her mouth again she might try to bite him, or rip his throat and let his life's blood spill onto the ground.

\thought{No, that's not you, that's \emph{her}}, she forcibly reminded herself.

She wouldn't mention the beast's name, not even in thought. Not anymore.

\enquote{If you'd like to follow me, I'll escort you inside}, the blue-cloaked man told her.

A part of her thought \thought{you shouldn't escort me, fool, you should shackle me and throw me in a dungeon}, another part \thought{you should ride out and do to to my wolf, instead. It was hear who killed them all, not me.}

When she'd last stepped though these gates, she'd feared she wouldn't be welcomed back.

Now, she half believed she \emph{shouldn't} be welcomed back.

Walking through the courtyard behind her guard -- that was what he was, even if he didn't know it yet, her \emph{guard}, not to protect her from others, but to protect others from \emph{her} -- she remembered the forest, and the road that led through it, on the last day before she and Gendry had first come to this castle.

Dimly, she recalled being afraid that people would call her a monster if she ever showed her face. She wondered what she'd do, now, if anyone would jeer at her, hiss at her and call her a skinchanger, an abomination.

\thought{Maybe I'd agree.}

But though the courtyard was busy no one looked twice at her, and no voices came hissing, condemning.

They stopped in front of the Great Hall, and her guard had some words with the man at the door. He made no effort to keep his voice down so she couldn't hear, which struck her as odd, until she remembered that he didn't yet know who his was guarding from whom.

It didn't matter, though. She didn't listen, anyways. Maybe, once, she would've, though she couldn't be too sure.

\enquote{Princess, I fear you have missed the feast.}

\thought{What cause could anyone have to host a feast, here, now?}

Her puzzlement must have clearly been imprinted on her face, for a moment later her guard said:

\enquote{It's in your royal brother's honour, Princess. He has returned from the east, victorious over the Lannister beasts.}

\thought{He's beaten beasts}, she thought, \thought{and now I'm a beast, too.}

Her mouth gave a hysterical laugh, while the rest of her wondered why it did that.

\thought{He's save. He's save.}

Desperately, she tried to focus on that, tried to drown out everything else from her mind. It worked as surely as not thinking of the perpetual screams in her head would've worked, which is to say it didn't work at all.

Her guard looked at her oddly, but said no more. For quite some while they stood there, while the other man who'd stood at the gate went running, presumably to her brother, or maybe the steward.

\thought{Crying, screaming and shouting.}

Once he'd stopped talking, the noises in her head became louder again, as if she was back on the red field again, on the monster's back.

\thought{Dying and routing.}

At last someone else came up to them, a lean man with a weathered face and gray hair. He had a sword at his side, too, though he'd taken his armour off. Arya turned to look at him, hoping that he'd remind her less of the field than the guard with his mail did.

At the sight of her he gave an amused smile, even if one with an underlying seriousness. Then, without further ado, he strolled up to her and hugged her fierce.

For some moments, she was too surprised to offer him any resistance.

\enquote{You}, he said in a smoky, hoarse voice, though much stronger than she'd expected from a man like that, \enquote{are definitely my niece's daughter.}

Only then did she realize who he was, who he must be. The blackfish, her mother's father's brother. Part of her could just make out Septa Mordane's angry shouts, since she hadn't realized it by the black fish that was embroidered on his tunic, though she ignored that.

Resolutely, though somewhat reluctantly, she pushed him away. Not that it hadn't felt nice, in fact, the man had something loving and caring about him in a wholly unexpected way -- she'd certainly never known her father to make such a display in front of half the castle. She just didn't see the point in anyone hugging her.

\enquote{Welcome to Riverrun. By rights, that would be my brother's sentence, or maybe my nephew's, but since neither is here you'll have to take it from someone who hasn't been to this castle for more than ten years.}

What he said seemed so absurdly irrelevant to her she didn't know whether to be confused or amused, though her mind never really considered either of the two -- for the most part it chose to ignore him entirely.

\enquote{His grace, your brother, isn't here right now either, may the Seven bless him -- well, though I'm not a septon, I'd say they could hardly bless him more than they already did -- and neither is Cat -- though maybe I should call her your mother.}

She wanted to snap at him, tell him that \emph{of course} she knew who her mother was, and the guard had already told her of Robb's victories. Looking around, she realized he wasn't here anymore. Dimly, she concluded that her uncle must have dismissed him.

\enquote{They're both up in the private council chamber, and as long as they're stuffed up there and we don't hear from them, you'll have to put up with me.}

For a moment he was quite, then suddenly, as if it had just occurred to him that something about their situation was a little odd, he continued.

\enquote{I guess I should be all outraged that the first time I see my grandniece I find her covered in mud, her clothes all torn and worn with no pretty dress in sight, but you know what? I'm not really too surprised.}

\thought{No}, she thought, \thought{I'm a monster, maybe, and even if not I'm a skinchanger. Of course everybody would expect me to look all torn and scratched and bloody.}

\enquote{No, I'm really not surprised, not with your mother.} -- \thought{What?} -- \enquote{She used to play outside as well, all the time. She and her sister, and that boy from the fingers, all three of them, they'd go out down to the river, where they'd find some way or other to try and get rid of whatever man had been assigned the bitter luck to keep an eye one them -- I should now, half the time, that man was me -- and then they'd come back inside at some ungodly hour, all covered in mud. Your mother, she was the worst of the lot. Once I asked her what she'd done. You know what she said?}

The last he said in a low, conspirational tone, bending down towards her as he did, as if he was about to share some great secret, and maybe he was.

\enquote{She stood right up, the image of a lady, and said: \enquote{We baked mud pies for Petyr. He found them quite delicious, he assured us, though he liked mine a little better than my sister's}.}

If she'd been in her normal state of mind, it would've been about now that her mind would've started spinning and doubling over to try and accommodate a mental picture of her mother making mud pies and feeding them to a boy. But of course she \emph{wasn't} entirely in her right state of mind, so now only part of her mind started spinning, tumbling up the rest, wrapping around and shaking it in the oddest of places.

\thought{Maybe he's lying}, she finally concluded. \thought{Yes, that must be it.} Nothing could be more absurd than her mother making mud pies. \thought{I hate him. Who's he to speak about her in such a way?}

\enquote{And now I come in this yard to find a little girl, clearly having spent some time near a river, with one of the household's men standing by her clearly there to keep an eye on her, with the distinct look of someone who failed at his task. Who else could this girl be, then, if not of my family and house? Ah, there comes the running boy.}

Indeed he did, though only someone as old as him could've rightfully called that man a \emph{boy}.

\enquote{Princess Arya, if you would follow me? Your mother requests your presence.}

\enquote{That's it, I'm afraid}, her uncle told her, \enquote{was nice to meet you, little princess.}

Arya could hear Septa Mordane telling her to say something like \emph{it was a pleasure, ser}, though she ignored it. The man was probably a liar -- she was almost sure he'd made all this up, and there was simply no way he truly thought she'd just spend an afternoon at a river, not with the way she had blood still sticking to her -- and anyways he shouldn't talk to her. There'd been men with gray hair, too, back at the field, and she'd seen them dead as well.

She entered the great hall after her guard. Inside, it felt so very much like it had done before it \emph{hurt}. In the dim light, she could just see the high table, where once she'd made her mother place Gendry, right next to her. Now it all seemed a thousand miles away, unreachable forever.

Together, they strolled through it, almost all the way to the dais before the steward turned aside and led her to a small door she'd never noticed before. Behind it was a small, winding staircase, and at the top another door.

Her mother was waiting behind it, she knew.

\thought{Crying and screaming and shouting}, she thought, then pushed it all away. To her surprise, it almost worked, too.

She took a deep breath, and opened the door.

\enquote{Arya}, came a cry, and for the second time that day she found herself snuggled tightly in between someone's arms. Again, she pushed it away, then took in her surroundings.

She didn't manage it, as she promptly found herself in another embrace, this time her brother's. It was accompanied by a loud \emph{clonk} and someone drawing a sharp breath. Only once she'd pushed him away, too, did she see that his crown had just fallen to the ground. Robb bent down, inspected if it was still all right and placed it on his head again.

And then suddenly, screeching, it all grind to a halt. Somehow, she'd expected a third embrace, but that one never came.

\thought{Of course he's not here, Gendry doesn't have any business being at a private meeting like this, whatever it's about --}

There he stood.

Inexplicably she found herself taking a step forwards, then another, and another, until she was almost running, ready to jump into his arms.

Then she saw that not only did he not wear any decent shirt -- she hadn't really noticed that; in all the time they'd spent on the road none of them ever really had any proper clothes, and none of them had cared or remarked upon it -- but that also he held his hands behind his shoulders, which was something she'd never seen him do before. \thought{And if anyone's been playing in mud lately, it's him.} There was some smell about him, too, though Arya tried not to think on it. Smelling was something that reminded her of the time she'd spent in her wolf's mind too much.

Gendry was gaping at her, astonishment clearly writ upon his face.

Then a suspicion overcame her, and with a quick look to his feet she'd already confirmed it. There was a chain between them. Behind him stood a guard, holding him in place.

For a moment, just a single, terrible moment, nothing at all happened.

Then the moment was gone, and Arya's mouth fell open, while she was searching for words for it that might \emph{possibly} fit in this situation.

Suddenly all the screams shouted a single word in her head.

\thought{No.}

\thought{No!}

\thought{But I left the letter, and --}

She cut herself off. Time to wonder later.

\enquote{Release him.}

\thought{Not him! Why he? Why? I told them it wasn't his fault, I told them it was mine alone, I'm the one who's done all that, I'm the one who's rode out on Nymeria to kill, not \emph{him}!}

Nothing happened, and Arya became desperate.

Screams and shouts engulfed her head, of the people she'd killed, of the act that had made her a monster, or maybe a beast. She wasn't sure.

\thought{But if I am a monster, at least let me use it to do him some good. He doesn't deserve what's been done to him.}

\enquote{\emph{Release him}}, she said again, her voice ice in a way her father's had never been, with an underlying fury and madness.

\enquote{Did any of you ever wonder where Lord Tywin's army has gone?} -- from their faces, it was clear that they hadn't, though Arya didn't really notice -- \enquote{Well, you won't find it, not anymore. You won't find them because I just came back from a battlefield where I \emph{butchered} them, every single one, \emph{all} of them no matter age or sex or weapons. I could rip any one of you to pieces without lifting a finger} -- and as if to emphasise her words, suddenly the howling of wolves came from the windows, while Arya saw with satisfaction the blank horror on the guard's face -- \enquote{No matter what you think he's done, you will forget it, \emph{now}, and you \emph{will RELEASE HIM!}}

With a look of terror the guard complied, his hands shuddering, even before Robb finally gave the command for him to do so.

Shaking, Arya longed for breath, while slowly she realized what she'd done. Some part of her must've reached out to the wolves, to Nymeria. All this time she'd looked back over her shoulder, and never once had she realized that it wasn't the field she was fearing to see, it was \emph{them}, the wolves, and her fear that she might go with them to continue what she'd already started.

\thought{Never again}, she swore herself. Then she had one last look at Gendry, mouthed him a silent \emph{sorry} before she stormed out of the room, down the staircase and through the hall, never once looking round. Finally, when she reached her own chambers she bolted the door, then went into her sleeping-chamber, closed the door to \emph{that}, and then, when that one didn't have a bolt, shoved her bed in front of it so it wouldn't open.

She wasn't even sure if she was locking them all \emph{out}, or herself \emph{in}.





\chapter*{Epilogue}

\chbegin{A}{s he stepped through the portcullis} Theon could feel the dead boy's heads watching, even though he knew that by now they'd only empty sockets where their eyes had once been. The Crows and Ravens had seen to that.

Slowly, he made his way into the Winter Town. Ser Rodrik was waiting for him at the market square, his gelding beside him. The boy Cley Cerwyn stood there, too, proudly displaying the banner with the direwolf of Stark flattering above him. And though they appeared to be alone, Theon knew that on the roofs of nearby houses and in hidden alleyways were scores of archers and footmen, just beyond his sight.

\enquote{It grieves me that we must meet as foes, Ser Rodrik}

\enquote{My own grief is that I must wait a while to hang you, Theon \emph{Turncloak}.} He spat on the ground at that, hatred written clearly into his features.

\enquote{I am a Greyjoy of Pyke}, Theon reminded him, \enquote{Heir to the Iron Islands.}

\enquote{For ten years you have been a ward of Stark.}

\enquote{Hostage and prisoner, I'd name it.}

\enquote{Then perhaps Lord Eddard should have had you chained to a dungeon's wall. Instead, he raised you alongside his own sons, with two of them being the poor boys you have butchered. It'll be my own undying shame that I ever placed a sword in your hand, instead of one struck into your belly.}

\enquote{I am not here to suffer your insults. Say what you will have of me.}

\enquote{Only two things,} the old man said, \enquote{Winterfell, and your life. Command your men to open the gates and leave. All your men who had no part in the killing of Children may go in peace and make their own way to their homes. You yourself shall be held to await King Robb's justice. May the Gods take pity on you when he returns.}

\enquote{Robb will never return here again. His brave men  will break themselves against Moat Cailin which my uncle holds, just as every southron army has ever done. The North is ours, now.}

\thought{I'm not stupid, Ser Rodrik. And I did listen to your lessons, and to those of Maester Luwin.}

\enquote{All that's yours are three castle}, the man allowed, \enquote{and I mean to reduce that figure to two.}

Ignoring him, Theon said, \enquote{Well then, here are \emph{my} terms. You have until the sun sets to disband your men. Explain to them that everyone who will be found in the vicinity of Winterfell after that time will be taken and executed as a traitor to the North.}

Young Cerwyn's face was the very image of someone being incredulous. \enquote{Are you mad, Turncloak?}

But all Theon had to do in reply was to raise one hand, and watch the horror spread over both of their faces. Winterfell's gate was right behind him, so he couldn't see what was happening, but Cerwyn and Cassel could not fail to get a good look at the girl with the noose around her neck.

\enquote{You've descended to \emph{that?} To use a child in such a way?}

\enquote{Do not think that I am unfamiliar with it. I myself was taken as a boy of ten.}

\enquote{It's not the same!}

\enquote{Maybe my noose wasn't made of solid rope, but it chafed me all the worse for it.}

He'd never really thought of it in this way, but as he spoke these words aloud, he knew that they were true.

\enquote{No harm was ever done to you.}

\enquote{And neither will any harm befall her, Ser Rodrik. Your armies will disperse before sunset. Remember that you have a duty to your own house as well, and apart from you Beth is its last of its blood.}

\enquote{I give you the chance to die with even just a shred of honour, and you spit it back into my face.} His hand rested on his sword, now. \enquote{Truly, I should've known better than to deal with a child-killer.}

Theon didn't fear the old man. The archers on the roofs around him, though, they were a different matter …

\enquote{Will you accept my terms?}

A hesitation, then: \enquote{I've got a duty to my king.}

\enquote{And to your own house as well}, Theon reminded him. \enquote{If just one of your men is still remaining here by nightfall she'll hang. At dawn tomorrow, someone else will follow her, and after that at dusk as well, every day, until every last one of your men is gone.}

Without waiting for any answer Theon wheeled his horse around and fled back into the safety of his castle's walls.

\thought{Though it's a shaky safety, at best.}

Black Lorren was there when he rode into the yard and handed Smiler's reins to Wax. \enquote{We'll know by nightfall}, Theon told him.

Though he gave a nod, he could see that the man's eyes were full of contempt. He ignored him, and made his way inside the main keep.

A fire had been laid in Ned Stark's bedchamber. Theon sat beside it, a cup of heavy-bodied red from the castle vaults in hands.

\thought{It's as sour as my mood.}

At least he was still alive, he thought. If it had been his own father at the walls and him there in the noose, Winterfell wouldn've fallen already while he'd be lying dead in the mud, trampled by the other man.

He thought he knew that Ser Rodrik would not attack, but …

\thought{He cannot attack, but neither can I follow up on my threat. If Beth dies, they'll be over the walls in little more than a minute.}

There was little use in lying to himself there. The few men that had stayed with him until now might be brave and some of the best men that Pyke had had to offer -- at least on that count Asha hadn't taken everything away from him -- but while they might take out twice or thrice their own number, eventually they'd be overwhelmed.

And even the double walls of Winterfell would offer little protection without men to hold them. The stonework was old, and rough, more than apt for even a half-skilled climber, and without men on the battlements to hold them back …

It truly was only that old fool's fear for his girl's life that kept them at bay for now.

The cup of wine was only half-way gone when he called for Wex to fetch his bow, but it hadn't brought him any solace anyways, so Theon left it there.

The afternoon he spent in the yard, practising his archery, while slowly the shadows crept up to him as the sun sank in the sky. Winterfell had towers aplenty; now, they were like fingers and hands reaching out for him.

Again and again Theon shot arrows hitting the mark, pretending not to care, pretending not to notice.

But by the afternoon they'd got him.

\enquote{If you had a hundred bowmen of your skill, you might still stand a chance, my lord Prince.}

Theon turned to find Maester Luwin behind him, his face as kindly-looking as his voice.

\enquote{Go away.} When the old man didn't move, he added, \enquote{Or I'll put the next one through your chest.}

\enquote{No you won't.}

Theon gave him a startled look.

\enquote{Shall we make that a wager?}

\enquote{As Maester of the castle and your advisor, I wouldn't recommend it, my lord prince. I am your only hope.}

Clearly, the old fool didn't understand the situation.

\enquote{There's no hope for me. My father's given up on me even before I ever set foot on his islands, my sister has abandoned me first chance she got, not even that creature Reek I'd sent out has returned. I cannot win.}

\enquote{You do not need to win this war.} Maester Luwin's voice was soft, not in the way one would talk to a child, but in a way that just showed concern. Theon wasn't sure if that was worse or not. 

\enquote{There is another option you might want to consider, my lord Prince.}

\enquote{Yeah? And what would that be, then? To Kill myself and be done with it? You really should know me better than to suggest that.}

\enquote{I do not wish for you to die, Theon. True, I will never love you, but you are still the boy I taught most of what he knows now. And in any event, as Maester I am sworn to this castle, not its lord, and I am sworn to give counsel. And right now I counsel you to take this: Do not attempt to win this fight, as you plainly cannot. Instead, take up the black. Ser Rodrik is as honourable as any man, and he will have to accept it, even if grudgingly so. And in the watch, any man can rise high, with all their previous deeds washed away forever.}

\thought{Taking the black}. Now there was an option that had never crossed his mind before. Not a month ago, he'd called the very idea of a Greyjoy joining the watch to be absurd, something that was reserved for bastards only, but now … \thought{The watch can't be too bad, I suppose. Lord Stark's own brother joined it, as did his bastard son.}

Turning it in its head, it seemingly became more and more attractive by the second.

\thought{My sins would be forgiven. Maybe I'd be stationed at Eastwatch, even, where I could command my own ship. Yes}, he thought, \thought{let Asha keep her grubby wet islands, I'll be at Eastwatch, and away from these shitty islands I once had to call home.}

As for women … well, what wildling girl might not want to spend the night with a true prince from the south?

But before he could reach a decision either way, a shout broke through his thoughts.

\enquote{Prince Theon!}, Black Lorren's voice boomed as he came running towards them.

\enquote{Is it the northmen? Have they started their attack?} \thought{By the Drowned God, but I thought he had honour.}

\enquote{No,} continued he, panting as he reached his prince, \enquote{but there have come forces to join them. Not too many, but if we didn't stand a chance before, then I don't know what we have now. There are no signs of preparing an attack, not as of yet, but they could do it any moment now, and we'd be too slow even to react to them.}

\enquote{Any banners?}

\enquote{A flayed man, Prince Theon.}

\thought{So the Boltons have come to join them, too.} Well, it mattered but little to him, whether Cassel had a thousand or two thousand men to command. There was still Beth at the gate, holding them at bay …

\thought{Maybe,} Theon thought, \thought{the sight of the boy's head will be proof enough for them that I do not make idle threats. Maybe I should have had Mikken's head there, too.}

The dead Blacksmith's large head would surely have made an impressive sight …

But again he was ripped from his thoughts, this time by horns and the alarm.

Shouts drifted into the yards from outside, and soon everyone could sense a battle going its way beyond the walls, while what few men remained to him rushed up to the battlements, bows and axes in hand.

\enquote{\emph{Hang the girl!}}, Theon tried to shout over the noise and confusion, though to little avail, but at last he saw that Beth Cassel was already dangling at the rope as surely as he himself had done so many years. \emph{Someone} must've decided to do as he'd been told, at least.

But it didn't take long until someone else cut the rope -- \emph{traitors!}, Theon thought -- even before the walls itself were stormed, and stormed they were. The massive double walls might be difficult and risky to climb if in a hurry, but they did it readily enough, and soon the battlements were swarming with men.

Arrows hailed on them, but not nearly enough to make a difference; He himself took out several of them -- he did not know their exact number, nor did would he ever care to learn it -- if there had been boiling oil or water to pour down on them …

\thought{No use thinking of might've beens}, he told himself, as the northmen came closer, screaming in their rage.

Finally men came from the sides; they must've climbed up on some other part of the wall he hadn't had the men to guard. 

Theon cursed himself for having no sword readily it hand; he'd left it with Wex before, when he'd started practising with the bow. So the cuts came to no surprise for him, nor the blood flowing down his face and covering his eyes.

Thunder and shouts sounded around him, as Theon Greyjoy prepared to draw his last breath. Falling, he thought he could see an old man -- Ser Rodrik? Lord Stark? His own father? -- storming through the yard, shouting in anguish, while a figure like a demon stared at him from above …

With a \emph{Splat} on the muddy ground, Theon Greyjoy was dead.



\part*{Not to Despair}

% In general, as a sort of overlying theme: things are bad, but you shouldn't despare, no matter what happens, 'cause you'll miss the sparks of hope if you do.



\chapter*{Gendry}


\chbegin{R}{inging, ringing, always ringing was the steel}, and Gendry did his best to keep it that way. He was determined not to give anyone cause to wonder about his presence there, inside Master Rymond's forge. It felt good to be back in one again, almost like coming home, and he'd even exchanged a few words with Kevan and Koval, but of course it was obvious that they didn't really feel like he belonged.

The squire of Ser Brynden Tully just wasn't really supposed to be doing the work of a common man.

\thought{And who'd ever prefer smithing to squiring, anyway?} Gendry could certainly think of no one but himself, and even he would've scoffed at the very thought of this idea just a fortnight ago.

Before the dungeon.

Before the wolves, howling, always howling in his head and dreams and memories.

Now, every time he had a sword in hand, intending to fight with it, even if it was just a mock-fight, suddenly he felt all squesy and more uncomfortable than he'd care to admit to anyone.

What made it worse was that he wasn't really \emph{against} the fighting, either. Sometimes it even went fine, and sometimes he almost enjoyed it, to. But then at other times he couldn't help but think of Arya asking him to spar with her, and from there it was only a short way to her speaking up for him in that chamber, and then to the dark, wet walls enclosing him while he lay on -- or rather, \emph{in} -- a muddy patch of ground and his own shit.

And now he was out of it, rewarded for something he wasn't sure he'd ever done, and somehow wanted none of it.

\thought{Bloody idiot, you should be enjoying yourself while it lasts, not shun somethin' every damned riverlord's son's been dreamin' about since he's learnt how to walk.}

Truly, how many boys \emph{would} shun the chance to squire for someone with such a name? Gendry had been born and stayed in the City for all his life, but even he knew who Ser Brynden Tully was. Maybe there weren't as many stories about him as there were about Ser Arthur Dayne, or Ser Barristan the Bold, but he was still a well-known man, and unlike some other well-known ones, respected.

Moreover, it was well-known that Ser Brynden Tully wasn't one to take on squires. It had taken him a while to figure that one out -- everyone but him had assumed that it was common knowledge, and perhaps it was, here -- which made the who business even more unusual than it had already been.

Somehow, sometimes he felt that he'd preferred to squire for someone less noteworthy; that, he felt, would have been less inadequate.

And then he'd burst into a fit of laughter because the idea of him squiring for anybody, even a hedge knight, had always belonged into idle daydreams, not into his real life.

He knew he should be happy, and suspected that he was, somewhere, but still …

\thought{If it wasn't the Blackfish …}

Maybe then he'd be able to beat out a sword without seeming suspicious, without asking eyes hovering over him, constantly. He could practically \emph{feel} their thoughts, their questions, the questions of those that didn't understand.

\enquote{Ah, there you are, boy! I've been running all over the bloody castle in search of you, though I'd suppose this should've been the obvious place to look.}

At last, his knight had found him. Somewhere, in some deep pit inside him, he suspected he was even a bit proud of it all.

Anyway, that was deep inside him, and he wasn't really sure of it himself, either.

\enquote{Time for lessons, you know. Can't just do nothing all day. But then, I'd hardly call all that hammering \emph{nothing}, if I were honest.}

The old man gave a laugh, then walked out of the forge again.

Nimbly, Gendry followed him out. Together they crossed the little yards, came by barracks that hadn't been there the day before  or that Gendry hadn't noticed yet, crossed the small arm of the Tumblestone that flowed right through the castle -- hence its name -- walked by some more badly-built shelters full of peasants who'd run from the fighting on the river's other side, all the way into the training yard of Riverrun.

He suspected he shouldn't feel any disappointment over the fact that Arya wasn't there, but could do little to avoid it. \thought{Stupid! By now I should know better}, he thought to himself, \thought{she's never here, not anymore.}

In fact, come to think of it, he'd seen her but once since she'd come back, and that was when she'd called the wolves to howl, and threatened to lead them into battle yet again.

\thought{Warg}, he thought, \enquote{You shouldn't be so surprised, fool!}

Still, he \emph{had} been surprised by what she'd done in that little chamber. Not so much at what she could do, he'd seen some of that before, after all, and if it now was much more impressive, well, then obviously she'd gained practice. The howls might haunt him now, but it were her words that had truly terrified him. By now he knew when she was lying, and she hadn't been lying, then, when she told them about the people she'd killed, or that she'd readily kill some more to get him out of his chains.

\thought{And she used it all to free me.}

He wasn't sure what to think about that. If she'd never told anyone, why, she'd just be the same Arya that had been gone. But now she'd chosen to tell everyone, and all only to get him out of his chains.

By the time he had gotten his hands on a practice sword Gendry was confused, and probably a bit angry, too, though he wasn't sure as to why or at what. Maybe at the world, he thought, or maybe just himself. Maybe at Arya, too, who'd turned up playing the part of monster and hero both at once only to disappear into her chamber, and never again coming out.

And since he didn't want to intrude on her -- and probably a bit afraid of her, too, he admitted to himself -- he didn't go to see her, either, which meant that he'd lost the only friend he'd had in the castle.

He missed it. He missed the stories they used to trade in the evenings, missed the time when she'd made him drink sour wine and pretended, just for a moment, to be a real lady, and all that missing only served to make him angrier.

Though he never looked forward to it, he often hoped that the fighting would help, that hacking at the air or a wooden puppet or the Blackfish would somehow make him feel better, but it didn't. No matter how much he threw himself into it, no matter how hard he tried to hit the Blackfish, the old man wouldn't stop to slip from his grasp as easily as Arya had done, back on the run.

A blacksmith's strength, he'd found, were very little against the skill of any swordsman even if he was only half-trained, no matter how old he was or how white and weathered his hair, and no matter if the man was only a girl smaller than he himself.

In the end, when a small crowd had gathered for their gawking -- Riverrun was more a village than a castle now, in truth, with all the people who'd come here for protection having erected all sorts of crude shelters against the walls, and you didn't often got to see the Blackfish fight -- when Gendry was bathed in more sweat than after a good day in a forge, Ser Brynden let him go. Looking at the yard and the castle, Gendry could see the sun had already begun to set, casting the walls and people into sharp relief-like shadows, which made the world look almost dream-like. He might have fallen asleep then and there, or he might have started shouting at them all, but he kept himself back.

Around them, some boys had found sticks somewhere and where play-fighting on their own. He hadn't noticed them before, and now wondered how he'd managed that, with all the noise they made.

It took him some time to realize that what he'd first taken for screams was, in fact, laughter.

\thought{Wasn't long ago that I'd have played at swords, m'self.}

What a strange idea that seemed, now, to \emph{play} with swords.

The Blackfish gestured for him to follow, and together they made their way in the great hall, where it was quiet for now. Not long, and the crowd would come in, to sleep for the night.

\enquote{You did well, boy.}

\enquote{I was terrible.}

\enquote{No. Well, you were, in a way, I'd guess. But you've understood the important thing.}

Gendry was halfway through a defeated nod when he realized what the man had actually said. Surprised, he raised his head again, to look at the knight. He didn't understand at all.

\enquote{These boys out there, would you say they enjoy the bits of sparring they're doing?}

\enquote{I'd expect so.}

\enquote{What about you, then? Do you enjoy it?}

\enquote{No}, Gendry told the man, then added, \enquote{I hate it.}

\enquote{That's what I meant. You don't enjoy it. Look around you.}, he added, pointing at the empty tables, the abandoned dais, the few forgotten bits of straw lying on the ground, \enquote{Right now there's not much in here, but an hour or two and you'll find that scores of men, women and children come here for sleep every night.}

Gendry knew that, of course. He'd spent his first night in Riverrun in this hall, before he'd shared a room with Kevan and Koval.

\enquote{They had to flee from the fighting, or else they'd be dead by now.}

\enquote{And yet their children play at swords for fun. Surprising how many people never realize it, isn't it?}

\thought{Realize what?}

The Blackfish looked at him for a moment, straight in his eyes, then sighed and continued:

\enquote{Don't fight because you think it's fun. It's not, and never has been. Fight because you \emph{must}. You? You understand that. But think about how many knights there are in this war, right now, who haven't noticed that yet, and how many of them maybe never will.}

Finally, slowly, Gendry began to connect the dots, like how he'd combine the letters in Maester Vyman's lessons until they made a word.

\enquote{And so the people still have to run.}

\enquote{Exactly. You know why I never took any squires? I had one, once, and first thing the fool did when he'd been dubbed was to get himself killed.}

Finally, he understood, and that he already had. He wondered when that had happened. When they'd left the City? When Lommy had died? Or maybe only in the dungeon?

And now that he thought about it … why would one continue at all? Why had Ser Brynden taken on a lowborn nameless boy as squire when he'd refused high lord's sons?

The Blackfish had already turned back, and Gendry sensed that he'd been dismissed, but still, he couldn't help it, he had to know.

\enquote{So why have you taken on me, then?}

The old man looked back at him, his eyes weary and tired.

\enquote{Because when I first saw you, I recognized that look in your eyes, and knew that won't happen with you.}

Sweeping his arms around the hall, the Blackfish said: \enquote{Remember this, boy. Remember this hall, and those who have to sleep in it. And that knighthood isn't about fighting, or at least not only about it. Any old fool can learn how to fight. It's about when \emph{not} to fight.}

And while Ser Brynden turned around to walk back to his chambers, Gendry swore himself that he'd remember.

So lost to his thoughts, Gendry only looked up when the children began to come in, running and shouting around the hall before their parents -- if they still had parents, that was, if not, it was probably uncles or aunts or just whoever else was around -- put them to sleep on whatever pieces of straw they'd been able to find in the castle.

Numbly, he made his way to his own bed, now inside his own little chamber in the main keep, just beside the Blackfish's own. Sometimes he missed the company of friends around him, be they Arya or some of the boys at Master Mott's forge back in the City, or even Kevan and Kobal, whom he barely knew and had seldom exchanged as much as a word with.

At other times he'd just be glad to be alone, after a long and draining day of knighthood-training. Today almost felt like one of these times, except that Gendry wanted to tell someone a story, and there was nobody there to listen to it. He felt there should be a campfire somewhere, and the sounds of the wild around him. Now all he had was his bull's head's helmet, and it couldn't listen to stories, of course.

It surprised him how much he was missing that; after all, it hadn't really been the best of times. He'd started the storytelling when Arya hadn't said a word for days after she'd had to kill Lommy, while they were all starving and freezing out in the open, fearing the rain and cold as much as a bandit's knife. And yet somehow, it had managed to worm its way into his life so successfully that he couldn't really live without it anymore.

After quite some time he finally fell asleep, worn out from the day. Then he woke again not very much later, dimly remembering howls and shouts in his ears while he frantically searched with his hands for something evil and twisting and probably imagined, before falling back to sleep once more when he'd made sure that there was nothing there at all, and it had only been his mind tricking him.

When finally he woke to find it was \emph{actually} morning, he found himself wondering how Arya' night might've been. If there was anyone who could understand him now, than probably it would be her.

And not all that long ago, maybe he would've gone over to her chambers to ask her, or told her of his nightmare, or maybe even the story that he'd been itching to tell her the night before, though he'd by now mostly forgotten what it'd been about.

He was almost at it, before he remembered what had happened, and that he wasn't at all sure how to deal with her anymore. How did you talk to someone who'd slaughtered thousands?

Instead, that morning he had lessons with the maester -- letters, mostly, since the man said that he was surprisingly good with numbers, which Gendry suspected might be a result of Master Mott's drilling on the subject -- and after endless hours of sitting, bent over an old and dry piece of parchment all about horseshoes, fighting his way through it one letter and one word at a time, finally, something like an idea popped into his head.

If someone had written so much about \emph{horseshoes} of all things, why shouldn't have someone else written about wargs as well?

Surely, they were a more interesting topic?

And hadn't Arya said that some of the things she'd told him when they'd still been trading stories every night had been from books she'd read back in Winterfell?

Determined -- and Gendry could be stubborn, he knew that, he'd not made his helmet in a bull's shape for nothing -- he redoubled his efforts to learn. Maester Vyman had showed him his library when he'd first come in. Gendry had never been in one before, but it turned out that a library was a whole room full of books and loose pages. He hadn't really seen the point of it, then, but now …

\emph{There might}, he concluded, \emph{be something useful in there, after all.}


\chapter*{Robb}

\chbegin{R}{obb awoke early in the morning, and found his wife beside him.} For a part of him that still felt all new and unused to, something so very wonderful and exciting, and partly it was already so familiar that he couldn't imagine how he'd ever lived without Jeyne beside him in the mornings.

He sent a silent prayer of thanks to the Old Gods, who'd let him be born in the North, where husband and wife shared a chamber, not like in the south where they might live in completely different parts of a castle.

Looking over to her, Robb relished the few moments he still had left to just lie there and be happy, before he'd have to stand up and get to work, the last few moments of every morning he could pretend -- just for a moment -- would last forever.

Especially so today, when even these mornings wouldn't last all that much longer. He hadn't even told her that yet. It wasn't that he hadn't tried, he \emph{had}, but just couldn't bring himself to get the words out of his mouth. Maybe he should stay until she woke up and tell her then --- but then this morning would end up being more miserable than it already was, and in any case she'd know by midday so there wasn't really much of a point to it. That didn't stop him from feeling guilty.

Especially when somewhere in his mind he entertained entirely different ideas on what to do in the mornings, even when he knew that wouldn't do. He'd done his duty as a husband --- he took a moment to reflect on that, his \emph{duty}, which, from people like Maester Luwin and his father, had always seemed to be a necessary task to be done and not the sweetest thing there was and ever could be --- before they'd went to sleep last night, and Jeyne had taken her mother's fertility potion again as well. To do any more would have been bound to be excessive, surely?

He wondered what would happen when she'd actually give him a child. How long would it be before they couldn't …

What would they do then?

\thought{Get these thoughts out of your mind}, he told himself, \thought{you're the King in the North, not a thrice-damned poet going on about his lady love, not even inside your head. That one poet downstairs composing songs about your love is already quite enough, you really aren't in need of another.}

With a sigh, he stood up -- carefully, so as to not wake Jeyne -- clothed himself, and tried to be awake.

He wasn't sure if he succeeded, but then, last night had certainly been sweet enough to warrant a bit of sleepiness?

\thought{Not likely that Edmure will care, though.}

That man was now constantly babbeling about how he'd insulted the Freys, and although this showed that the man \emph{did} have more insight than Robb had been able to discern from the men's plans, talk of old Walder Frey wasn't something he entirely appreciated when his head was all full of memories from last night …

Somewhere some part of him insisted that he really shouldn't dwell on that any longer. Some other part told him that then he'd have to dwell on something else, like the continuing lack of news from Winterfell and Ser Rodrick. Finally, he just tried to ignore all of it.

There were, after all, enough other problems at hand. Making his way through his study and down the stairs, Robb wondered what to do with the man. The smallfolk inside the walls had been a good idea, he'd decided, and better than what most southron lords would've done, but that didn't change the fact that Riverrun couldn't afford to feed them all for very long.

And as for his uncle's strategic blunders …

Half of him had wanted to send a raven bearing his thanks to Jon Snow the instant his lady mother had told him how Arya had come to know of battle-plans, though he'd been somewhat conflicted on exactly what to put in it --- should he mention that she'd also killed Tywin Lannister? ---, and in the end he'd never send one at all.

Also, of course, there was the matter of that boy Gendry. Robb wondered how a man who cared about his smallfolk enough to grant them such a protection could throw a clearly innocent boy into a dungeon, even more so when there was a letter from the supposed victim clearly stating that the boy was not to be punished and instead to receive a knight's education.

Especially if said boy was unable to read, although Robb supposed that would change soon enough. Arya herself had asked for him to be educated as a knight, after all, and Robb certainly wouldn't have denied her that wish, although he \emph{had} been somewhat surprised when Ser Brynden had offered to do it.

His great-uncle certainly wasn't known for taking on squires.

Ser --- Robb felt someone should remind the man more that he wasn't quite a lord yet --- Edmure's manservant told him that his master was still asleep, so Robb left orders to send for him once he'd woken; in the meanwhile, he'd be in the library.

Grey Wind was in the kennel for now, but Robb wondered if that was enough. Ever since his direwolf had begun to scare his wife's family he'd become somewhat suspicious of the beast, and Arya's tale --- though related to him through his mother --- had certainly done little to ease his fear.

Riverrun's library was small, not half as many books as there'd been in Winterfell -- and even that, Maester Luwin had called \emph{small}, though he and Jon had both agreed that it had been a truly extraordinary amount, and even after half of it had burnt Robb wouldn't exactly call it \emph{small} -- and he slowly worked his way through it, in search of every little half-sentence about direwolves he could find, which, he'd been disappointed to learn, was almost insultingly little.

Mostly, that was the reason he rose so early; with all that he had to do, there wasn't time enough to do this sometime during the day.

Maester Vyman was always glad to admit him --- the man rose even earlier than his king did, claiming that in his old days, he needed less sleep that he'd used to --- and sometimes even pointed out interesting volumes that Robb might consult, though Vyman would readily admit that he lacked a thorough understanding of the subject of direwolves, or even normal wolves, and that such matters were thought of little interest unworthy of study at the Citadel.

After some days of searching, Robb knew this was more than true. More or less, he'd given up hope on ever finding anything that wasn't a tale. Most of them were quite nice, some reminded him of the sort of story that Old Nan might tell, tales of evil wargs and kinslaying monsters. And even without Maester Luwin's teachings and Maester Vyman's words of caution that wasn't something he'd bet his direwolf's live on.

\enquote{Ah, your Grace! It seems you're becoming something of a regular, if you'll forgive the remark. I presume you wish to visit this castle's humble library once again?}

\enquote{If there have been no ravens today, yes.}

\enquote{Not one, your Grace. Not a single one since Lord Bolton's old relating of rumours, I'm afraid. Still, a day so young that it's still black outside, much might still happen. Ravens travel seldom in the dark, your Grace; to receive one at this hour it almost unheard-of. Maybe later today, your Grace.}

\enquote{Maybe}, Robb agreed.

\enquote{I'll see that you are at once informed should anything arrive, of course}, the maester assured him. Then, while both were walking down the final set of stairs, outside and through the yard towards the Library Tower --- that was Robb's name for it, in fact, he felt that a castle ought to have a Library Tower, as Winterfell did --- he added, \enquote{You'll find you have company today, your Grace}, said the Maester, while fishing for the right key to open the heavy iron-bolted door.

\enquote{Company?}

Robb couldn't imagine who else would be up and reading at this hour. For a moment his mind conjured the image of Arya, on the same search as he was himself, up this early so no one would notice her.

It didn't seem to him that she liked to be noticed since he'd come back; in fact, he hadn't seen her at all after she'd fled out of that meeting-chamber.

He longed to speak with her again, but didn't want to intrude on her, either, not when her maid claimed that Arya wouldn't receive anyone, not even a king.

\enquote{The young man you've ordered me to teach}, Vyman was saying, ripping him back in front of the library door and out of his thoughts, \enquote{it's a rare and admirable trait in the young these days, I've found, to be studying tirelessly so early in the morning. He wasn't the most attentive of my students at first, but now that he's learnt at least a basic array of skills, I'd be willing to say that he's been hooked up by it and now spends almost every of his free hours reading. Perhaps you ought to have sent him to the Citadel in place of the Blackfish.}

\thought{Arya's friend, that bastard Gendry? What's he doing here, he can't even read -- or at least not properly, not yet.}

He wasn't sure when he'd actually been able to read, but it had certainly not been less than a fortnight after Maester Luwin had started to teach him. Certainly much, \emph{much} longer until he'd started to read on his own when no one was forcing him to. And while it might be that Maester Luwin simply wasn't an adept teacher, that, to Robb, seemed more than simply absurd.

\thought{Seems the bastard really \emph{has} been hooked by something.}

Or the old man had just confused him with some other boy. Given the maester's age, Robb almost thought that credible.

But inside, at the single little table, bent over a volume that Robb recognized --- he'd consulted it himself, on his search --- he did indeed find Gendry. There was only the one table, though, so Robb resolved to seat himself across from him.

The boy evidently still found it hard to read, struggling through almost every word, sometimes reading them aloud until they made sense to him, and he was so absorbed by his task that at first he didn't notice that someone else had seated himself at the table.

\enquote{Your Grace}, he started when he did and recognized who it was, \enquote{I … Maybe I should better leave --}

\enquote{Please, don't be disturbed. \emph{A Collection of curious northern tales, of such matters as greenseers and wargs, with notes upon their untruths and their fallacies, by Maester Gerhald.}} -- the boy looked more than a bit impressed that Robb could read the title, given that it was upside-down for him -- \enquote{I've read it, though I can't say that I've enjoyed it, or found it to be of any use. I wonder if there's ever been a Maester of Winterfell who's felt more disdain for the people of his lord.}

\enquote{Tha' is … I just thought I might find somethin' in there, is all, your grace.}

Robb wondered what anyone could hope to find in an article about fallacies. Then again, the boy \emph{was} lowborn, maybe he just didn't know what \enquote{fallacy} even meant.

Unsurprisingly, he found as little in his own choice of reading -- today, it was \emph{An Account of a Ranger of the Night's Watch Concerning The Habits And Beliefs of The Wildlings} -- as he'd found in the days before, and when finally Edmure's messenger came for him he couldn't say that he was in the most agreeable mood.

And the prospect of talking to his uncle, and what they'd be talking about -- something Robb knew was necessary, but not actually entirely sure about --  did little to raise his spirits. But on his way he came across Jeyne coming by in the opposite direction, down the staircase from their chambers.

\enquote{Your Grace, I almost feared you had abandoned me!}, she told him in the most playful of voices.

\enquote{Oh, I could never leave you, believe me.} Thinking on what he would announce later this day, though, he quickly added \enquote{Not for long, anyways.}

The two shared a quick kiss and some complaints about his uncle before they had to part ways again -- Robb to Edmure's study, she to her mother's chamber. Robb didn't ask why, though he suspected it might be because of the rather-unsuccessful potion.

Still, when he finally reached the lord's study he felt much better than he had before, even with the unsolved problem of Grey Wind still wandering through his mind, and the anxiety of what else today might bring, and how his ideas about it would work out.

\enquote{Your Grace} -- Robb was glad Edmure had stopped calling him \emph{nephew} in these meetings. Not that he didn't like the man to be his uncle, but such things shouldn't be of concern when they met as lord and king, if anyone had asked him.

\enquote{My lord.}

\enquote{You wanted to talk to me?}

\enquote{I did. I do not expect that there has been any word from Winterfell?}

It hadn't been long since he'd asked Maester Vyman, but still. Even a king was allowed to entertain vain hopes.

For a moment the man looked as if he was pitying him, and Robb realized how much he sounded like a boy longing for his home.

\enquote{Last that we heard, Ser Rodrick was at Castle Cerwyn, a day's ride from Winterfell.}

\thought{Yes, thank you, I know how far it is from Winterfell to Castle Cerwyn}. The man's capacity to be annoying was truly amazing at times.

\enquote{I expect it was to much to hope for that the siege be over in a few days.}

\enquote{Maybe the raven got lost or delayed.}

\enquote{Maybe. But be that as it may, I do not intend to wait for it much longer.}

\enquote{Your Grace?}

\enquote{Whether King's Landing has fallen or not, whoever now sits the Iron Throne will first have to sort out the confusion that follows in the wake of a siege. If it's indeed Stannis who has won he'll have a hard time gaining the Tyrells, and if it's Joffrey … without Lord Tywin, he truly isn't much of a threat. Still, the wheel turns quickly sometimes and he might still surprise us, and I do not expect to have much time without a direct threat from the south. But I mean to use that time the best I can, to take back Moat Cailin, and reopen the road to the north. Without it, my kingdom lies in shreds.}

\enquote{Of course your Grace.}

\enquote{Further, I have decided to appoint Ser Brynden, your uncle, to the newly-created position of Warden of the Rivers. As such he will have the authority to command all our forces south of the neck, unless I directly order otherwise.}

There was a short hint of pain on his uncle's face; Robb knew that he'd made Ser Brynden almost Lord of Riverrun with this, and more or less publicly stated that he didn't trust Ser Edmure's capability as a commander in war.

\enquote{I will take all northmen in Riverrun and ride in two day's time, towards the Twins, where I'll meet up with Lord Bolton and his own forces.}

\enquote{Does your Grace truly consider that to be wise?}

\enquote{Walder Frey is a petty old man, but he wouldn't dare to threaten his king.}

\thought{Not while he knows as little of who holds King's Landing as I do.} That was the main reason Robb wanted to act. Even if by the time they were at the Twins a winner had established himself, there would've been little time for any secret negotiations between him and old Lord Frey.

\enquote{Maybe.}

\thought{Yes, maybe.} Robb certainly didn't look foreward to that meeting, and was more anxious about it than he let on.

The rest of the day was largely lost to preparations, although he did find some time to be with Jeyne -- who was, unfortunately though understandably, angry at him for \emph{actually} leaving him, although he promised he'd be with here again as soon as he could.

That afternoon he announced his decision in the Great Hall to his lords -- he'd had no worries about having trouble there, and indeed, they cheered him all, led by the Greatjon's booming voice, and if there was any dissent in the riverlord's faction with Ser Brynden's new title and powers, they were quickly drowned out -- to then first hold a discussion of possible strategies in his study and later receive anyone who after that still had questions. 

In between, when he had a moment to him alone, Robb looked own through the window into the yard, watching the boys there practising. Rollam Westerling, now his squire, was easily spotted --- he'd chosen him to remain at Riverrun, together with his sister Elayna, so Jeyne would have some familiar faces remaining with her --- as well as his older brother Ser Raynald, who'd come with him. He could spot Ser Brynden there as well --- he'd had a lengthy talk with him about his new position just an hour earlier --- training Gendry. It occurred to him that he was still thinking of him as a boy, though he truly wasn't much younger than himself, and, from the look of him, not as na\"ive as he'd been just a year ago.

The next two days passed in something of a blur --- preparations, talks to his men, working out plans and strategies with his lords and Maege Mormont, who'd seen more battles than most of the men and would endlessly tease them all about it. He also spoke to his mother about what he intended to do.

She, too, counselled him to be careful around Walder Frey, and to give a formal, public apology; he, in turn, instructed her that in the event that Stannis had actually won she should ride to meet him again. After all, the man \emph{had} promised to release Sansa should he capture her alive, and while Robb almost didn't dare to hope, maybe there was some little chance of piece there as well.

Finally, on his last evening in Riverrun, he made his way to Arya's chamber, but was told that she still wouldn't receive anyone. He had half a mind to ignore it and go in anyways -- he was the king, after all -- but instead he resolved to leave her alone if she truly wanted to.

Instead he went back to his study, took parchment and ink and wrote a lengthy letter to her, and while he was at it, he finally wrote one to Jon as well.

He left the first with Arya's maid -- it seemed to him that all the poor girl ever did was to stand around in the corridor in front of Arya's chamber door -- to be given to her at the first moment she didn't seem likely to just ignore it, and the second one with the maester, together with another, more formal letter to Lord Bolton containing orders to leave Harrenhal -- it would be held by a garrison appointed by Ser Brynden, though the man himself would remain in Riverrun for now -- and meet him at the twins.

Lastly, he also wrote one to Winterfell, in case it wasn't in Theon Greyjoy's hands anymore, stating his intention to go north in terms so obscure -- for all that it had been fruitless, his searching in the library \emph{had} equipped him with some words he was sure no one had used for a hundred years or more -- that he hoped only Maester Luwin would be able to figure out what they actually meant.

And then in what had seemed to him like no time at all he had to bid Jeyne farewell -- though he suspected that neither of them would be likely to forget their last night together any time soon -- face his uncle one last time, and say goodbye to his mother before riding through the eastern gate of Riverrun with his guards and knights around him, and be on his way.







\chapter*{Catelyn}


\chbegin {T}{here, on the table beside her father's bed,} lay the latter that called her away again. At last, Lord Bolton had sent word in his last letter before he left Harrenhal, word of Stannis's victory.

And as Robb had ordered, she'd have leave her home yet again, and treat with the man who could call demons on his enemies. She wondered if it was even of any use; a man of such power might just as well ignore any argument set in front of him, any plead and any request. There was no need for him to hold his word, nothing holding him to his promises.

In a very real sense, she felt like she thought a man might do, riding out and into battle. When she'd last been an envoy, she'd been sure of some basic things; most of all, she knew that no one would kill her deliberately, because no man would dare to kill an envoy, or else he'd forever be branded as untrustworthy.

Her Ned had called Stannis a good man, honest, honourable, and true to his word.

She hoped to all the Seven that he'd been right.

Otherwise, there was as much certainty of her coming back as with Robb and a battlefield. Maybe less, even.

\enquote {Watch for me, father}, she whispered, taking one last look at him --- he grew weaker by the hour, and Catelyn had little doubt this would be the final time she'd see him alive --- before she left her father's solar.

Down the stairs and halfway through the corridor she met her uncle again.

\enquote {How is he?}, Ser Brynden asked. It wasn't hard to guess where she'd been, she supposed.

\enquote {Dying}, Catelyn told him.

\enquote {Naah, I wouldn't say that. Your father's a fiercer man than I've ever been, he'll surprise us yet, you know how he is.}

She knew he was trying to make her smile, and it almost worked, too. But only almost, and not quite.

\enquote {So, you are on your way to Stannis?}

Catelyn hesitated for barely a moment, then sighed.

\enquote {Soon enough.}

Fear was apparently written clearly on her face; at least, her uncle had noticed it easily.

\enquote {There's not more to fear than when you rode to Renly. Stannis is a good man, and just.}

\enquote {So they keep telling me. I … you know what I've told you, and I cannot forget it, not for a moment.}

He was the only one she'd trusted enough to tell how Renly really had died; after they'd both heard the wolves calling, it had seemed less like a fantastic and outlandish tale than it had before. And to his credit, her uncle didn't brush her aside, though she wasn't quite sure if he'd believed it, either.

\enquote {I feel like I'm getting old, Cat. In my days, wars were fought with swords, not sorcery. But now … maybe you should ask your daughter for help,} he quipped, jokingly though he soon noticed it hadn't the desired effect. Catelyn wondered what had changed; not a fortnight ago he'd still had the miraculous power to make her laugh, no matter how dire things seemed.

\enquote {It's been a week since I've last seen Arya.}

\thought {Arya}, she thought, \thought {that has changed. I cannot laugh while my daughter shuts herself away from the world.}

\enquote {You should visit her, I'd think, before you're gone again.}

\thought {Yes, I know that. But now, to come to her only to say that I'm going away again … I should have seen her before.}

Still … with no word from Winterfell, and not a clue about whose side the Tyrells were on now, with so much left hanging in the air, with only the Gods knowing on which strings and how they'd swing …

Given all that, Catelyn resolved to tie up some loose ends, some things she should've done before. There was still an hour or two left before she had to ride through the gate. Brienne was outside together with Hallis Mollen, organizing the escort and their horses, so there wasn't much for her to do, except sometimes to wonder what the girl might do once they reached King's Landing, but of course she couldn't deny her the journey; she'd sworn an oath to that, after all.

So she bade her uncle farewell, turned on the spot, and started back towards the living chambers, towards Arya's. Her maid stood in front of the door, as bored and resigned as ever, clearly longing to be anywhere else, doing anything else than there. Catelyn felt sorry for the girl; as much as she was aware, the girl --- Bertha was her name --- did nothing but to stand there, since almost a fortnight, except to bring Arya food, seeing as steadfastly refused to leave her chambers.

\enquote {How is she?}

\enquote {I'm afraid I don't really know, m'lady. These days, all I'm doing is to guard this door and bring the lady her meals three times a day. Says she doesn't need me, or want me, for anything else, m'lady,} the girl told her.

\enquote {I assume she's never left her chambers?}

\enquote {No m'lady.}

\enquote {Has anyone come to see her?}

\enquote {The King's left a letter for her the day he rode out. I'm not sure if she's read it yet, though, but I gave it to her the morning afterwards, together with her breakfast. But apart from that there's been no one, and she told me not to let anyone in, anyway. M'lady.}

The way the girl almost forgot the courtesy made her think of why she'd chosen her; because Utherydes Wayn had told her she wasn't one of the overly-polite ones, rather the opposite.

\thought {If Arya ever actually spoke to her, I'd think they'd like each other.}

But of course Arya hadn't said more than a few words to anyone since she'd come back. And most of the time, these words amounted to different ways of saying \emph{leave me alone}.

\enquote {You can go in, of course. M'lady.}

Catelyn considered something for a moment, then replied:

\enquote {Should her friend ever come to call upon her, let him in, regardless what she's told you.}

\enquote {Her friend? I don't think I've met him before, m'lady.}

\thought {No, I only got you for her once she was away. Maybe that was too late. I'm always late, these days, it seems.}

\enquote {A lowborn boy, with black hair and blue eyes, a blacksmith, though now a squire. His name's Gendry.}

The girl nodded, and promised to let him in should he ever actually turn up, though Catelyn was surprised he hadn't tried yet.

Finally, she stepped through the door. She ignored the mess in the first room, quickly stepping through to her daughter's bedchamber, although she found the door to be barred. She found that irritating, because she couldn't remember that door having a bar, and she knew Riverrun as well as any woman could.

\thought {Maybe }

\enquote {Go away,} came Arya's voice.

\enquote {Arya! You \emph{will} let me in.}

In the end, she did get inside (to find that Arya had build a makeshift bar made of a heavy oak-wood chair), but she didn't stay there for very long. Somehow, Arya had managed to chase her away, even though she'd promised herself not to be easily thrown off, not this time.

It was her fault, though, in all likelihood. And, in hindsight, mentioning to someone who could control beasts that, according to rumour, these same beast were rampaging through the land leaving a trail of destruction and half-eaten bodies obviously hadn't been the best of her ideas, so she could scarcely fault Arya for that. Still, she'd hoped … with a jolt she realized she hadn't actually been sure what she'd been hoping for. Not pleasant conversation, that would've been impossible, surely. But maybe just a few honest sentences exchanged, and word of farewell.

At least she could now be sure that this hadn't been Arya's doing, could hate herself for even considering that possibility, even if just for a moment while being sure that it wasn't correct.

Still, it took her a moment to regain her self-control, no matter how practised it had become over the years.

Then she quietly went out and down the corridor, making her way towards the stables.

Crossing the courtyard she saw Gendry, Arya's friend.

\thought {I've done wrong to him, too}, she thought, wondering if maybe she should stop for a moment and tell him that. But as soon as he saw here the boy shied away, and Catelyn was left alone again, or as alone as one can be in a castle that feels more like a small town, with children running and playing all around her.

She remembered a girl baking mud pies, and suddenly dearly wished that she could've stayed there.

Of course that thought didn't help her, either, so she tried to drown it out.

Hallis Mollen appeared with her horse, along with Brienne and the rest of the guards Robb had set aside for her; and her brother came into the yard, too, she saw.

Mounting the horse, she said her farewell to her brother and a final one to the castle itself, then gave a wink up towards her father's solar, though of course he wouldn't be able to see that.

At last she had to ride out, towards a man who could call forth demons.

\thought {Watch for me, father.}









\chapter*{Gendry}

\chbegin{G}{endry stared at the boy in disbelief.} What was he doing \emph{here}? Not that he was strictly against meeting him again, it was just that it had seemed exceedingly unlikely. But across the table, in Riverrun's great hall, did indeed sit Hot Pie. In fact, he'd just placed himself of the bench there as if it was the most normal thing in the world, if a bit nervous-looking. Gendry found himself utterly stunned.

\thought{Here we are again, first time we meet in a month and I already look the idiot.}

\enquote{Yeah, jus' thought tha' perhaps I should say hello}, Hot Pie said.

There was silence for a moment, of that particular uncomfortable sort that Gendry had come to know much to well for his liking; the kind when neither really knew what to say next, or why they were even talking in the first place.

\enquote{All righ', maybe … not? Jus' thought that, ya know, ---}

\enquote{No, it's fine. Glad to see you're well. I just … didn't expect to see you again, is all.}

\enquote{Wasn't thinking that neither, m'self.}

\thought{Maybe I should ask what happened}, Gendry thought, but then, he didn't really have to. Arya might've used to call him stupid, but even \emph{he} couldn't miss the state Hot Pie was in. Clothes torn, dirt all over his face, a missing shoe, lacking the general air of contentedness he'd had when they'd said farewell, where he'd had flour all over his face instead. The boy looked utterly miserable; Gendry just hadn't noticed at first, when he'd been to stunned by his mere presence.

\thought {Weasel is missing, too.} He didn't really want to think on what that meant. If Hot Pie ran from the inn and left her behind, there wasn't much ambiguity as to what must have happened there.

\thought {Better not to mention that, though. He's looking depressed enough already, no need to add to that.}

So instead, Gendry asked, keeping his voice as normal as he could manage: \enquote{So, you're all right then? I mean, you're a cook, any chance of work here?}

Hot Pie took a look at the meagre dish in front of him --- largely consisting of something like broth, with some stuff in it that Gendry didn't really care about --- some kind of wheat maybe, swollen from the soup --- he'd just wolved his bits it all down after a day's worth of horse-riding without paying much attention to what he actually ate.

\enquote{Ya' know, they \emph{could} use some improvement with tha' stuff. Yeah, I know, all this might be under siege soon an' all o' tha', but 'tis not hard or expensive or anythin'. But no, don't have any work. Not yet at least.}

Dropping his voice a bit, Hot Pie admitted he hadn't yet worked up the courage to ask the steward.

Gendry was about to tell him it wasn't hard to convince the man you were worth something, in fact, it had been surprisingly easy when --- \thought{Oh. That was Arya's doing, most like.}

Hot Pie didn't seem to mind the lack of an answer; in fact, he'd happily continued working on some of the more chewy bits in today's stew.

\enquote{Anyway, what're you doin' here, now? Last I saw you an' Arry were just tryin' to get here like mad. Tho' I suppose I did tha', too, just somewhat later than ya two.}

\enquote{Ahm, well …} \thought{How do I tell him that I'm the Blackfish's squire without him thinking I'm just lying?} \enquote{Master Rymond --- he's the smith here --- took me on for a while.}

He had to stop there, any more and he'd just gotten tangled in his own words. If Hot Pie noticed, he just went smoothly over it.

\enquote{And Arry? He found anything to do?}

Instinctively, he turned to look at the hight table, with the vain hope that maybe today she'd be there, but of course she wasn't.

\enquote{Wha'? Where're ya looking at? Anyway, what abou' him?}

\thought{Him.} Gendry hadn't even remembered that Hot Pie had never learnt who \emph{Arry} truly was.

\thought{All you Seven}, he thought, \thought{why do you always have to throw me into these impossible conversations?}

Maybe he should try praying to a heart tree. If they let Arya kill Lord Tywin, surely they'd have the power to keep him away from his own awkwardness?

In any event, the next hour found him worn out, embarrassed, somewhat confused and definitely \emph{not} hiding in his chamber.

Although, to Gendry's surprise it had turned out that Hot Pie \emph{had} noticed something off about Arya, though he'd just figured she was on the run from something --- murder, perhaps --- or just possibly oppressing Gendry to go with her because there was no other sane reason for anyone to go into a castle that might be under siege.

Also, he'd promised him to ask Arya about doing whatever it was she'd done to get him work again to get Hot Pie a place in the kitchen.

It had been much too late when he'd realized he hadn't spoken with her for at least a fortnight, ever since she'd returned to Riverrun.

\thought{Ever since the wolves came howling.}

He'd have thought that would be less in his head after more than a week, or maybe disappear entirely, but somehow it hadn't. Probably it had stopped distracting him quite as much, or wasn't happening as often now as he'd been used to, but Gendry didn't really notice if that was the case. He still woke up almost every second night, panicking.

And anyway, after hearing her giving that speech … he knew she hadn't lied when she'd spoken about killing all these people. Even before King Robb had proclaimed that Lord Tywin was slain in battle --- someone somewhere had conjured a tale about unrest in his ranks, one or two bloody changes in his army's command chain, Gendry hadn't really cared --- there had been little doubt of it. Arya might be good at wearing masks, but he'd learnt how to notice them, and how to guess what lay beneath.

And he \emph{had} wanted to visit her, truly, it was just … every time he thought about actually doing it (which, to his shame, wasn't as often as it should've been) he'd start to wonder what she was like now, especially after what the Blackfish had told him about war and fighting. Most times, it had just been easier to tell himself \emph{tomorrow}, and then on the morrow maybe Ser Brynden would continue his lessons, or maybe Maester Vyman, and then of course he'd often be in the library, desperately trying to figure out what he might find should he actually go into her chamber. Not that it helped much; he just managed to read half a page an hour, and he had only an hour a day to spare. Maester Vyman might claim the library was small, but it definitely wasn't \emph{that} small.

Other times, he just convinced himself she wouldn't want to see him, anyways.

Although sometimes, before falling asleep, he'd want to tell her a story, or listen to one of hers, but normally he was to tired to stand up again, and anyways no one would let a bastard visit a lady's chamber at night. And once he woke again in the morning, like as not all of that would be gone from his mind, and so somehow he'd managed to never actually visit as much as her chamber door.

But now here he was, maybe a bit early in the morning --- he'd given up on finding anything in the library, with his meagre speed at reading --- and wondering if maybe she was still asleep, if maybe it would be better to wait …

\thought{No}, he told himself, \thought{You've been finding enough excuses. Just go there, ask that maid in front of the door if she's awake, that's not too much to expect.}

And anyway, that young woman there looked so bored it would've been cruel to vanish again without saying a word to her.

\enquote{Ah, pardon me, I just wanted to ask if A- … if m'lady … that is, if she might see me.}

The girl managed to give a truly impressive impression of utter disinterest, but began looking him up and down.

\enquote{Black hair, blue eyes, smith, apparently, … ah, wait, you're the one who's squiring for the Blackfish, aren't you?}

\enquote{Yes. I'm Gendry.}

\enquote{Pleasure to meet you. Wanted to see who you are for a while now, since Marya told me about it, but since I'm always just standing around here … Well, anyway, the Lady said you're allowed in.}

With that, she opened the door.

\thought{Well that was easy.}

\enquote{Now come on, go in, you know how heavy that door is?}

Gendry looked up at her, her thin form struggling with the weight of the wood and the beaten-out metal straps that made up part of the lock mechanism. He'd forged these things more than once, and they truly made for an impressively heavy door.

\enquote{Ah, sorry.}

Stepped inside, he stopped short after a moment, blinked, and tried to recognize the room. He knew her chambers well, of course, but suddenly everything seemed wrong and alien there. For one, Arya wasn't in the front chamber, as she usually was during the day. But that wasn't all, far from it. That little table where she'd once made him drink sour wine was missing its chairs, and everything seemed as if it had been abandoned for some while. When he'd been here, before, there'd always been scrolls lying around with half-written letters to her brother on them, or some drawings of Princess Nymeria (mostly paintings, though sometimes she'd draw one herself, too), and on occasion there'd be some wooden training (or, just once, a real) battleaxe or sword that she'd snatched from the training yard lying around. He remembered that she'd once challenged him to a fight in this chamber. There was something of a dent in the wall, just right to the door, to prove it.

Looking around, the only thing that Gendry could find that was definitely hers was Needle, lying in a corner as if cast away. It was bent, too, and something told him it had been thrown at a wall. Picking it up he tried to clean the little sword best as he could with his sleeve, before thinking that maybe he should get this down to the forge and sharpen it somewhat before he remembered what he was here for.

The door leading to the adjourning chamber where she slept was closed, but not barred. For a moment he considered just storming in, but knocked instead.

\enquote{Go away}, came a voice, just barely recognizable as Arya's.

What to do now? \thought{Not going, that's for sure. Although …}

\enquote{Pardon me, \emph{m'lady}, I'll leave you to your solitude.}

He'd picked that phrase up from the Blackfish, who used it whenever someone wasn't happy to see him, although Gendry had probably emphasized the \emph{m'lady} part more.

Half he'd hoped to hear her chuckle, but of course that didn't happen.

\enquote {Go away, Gendry.}

If there was one thing that she'd surprised him with in her answer, it was more the lack of a \emph{don't call me that} than telling him to go away.

\enquote {Your maid let me in.}

\enquote {Obviously.}

Gendry hoped she'd just rolled her eyes the same way she usually did.

\enquote {Just … go away. \emph{Please,} Gendry.}

Slowly, Gendry began to feel uncomfortable. When exactly had been the last time he'd heard her \emph{beg?}

\enquote {You all right in there?}

There was a longer pause than he'd expected from her, then:

\enquote {As much as I'd be anywhere else.}

\thought {I'm as fine as I'd be anywhere else.} Gendry was all to familiar with that thought. He'd made himself think it for almost a week. A week he'd spent starving in the City's streets, living in terror of every flap of a golden cloak his eyes would catch, after a man had caught him stealing and threatened to have him in a black cell.

\thought {If Arya's in any way similar to me, she's truly \emph{not} fine right now.}

\enquote {Arya?}, he called, \enquote {I'm coming in.}

\enquote {Yes. No, \emph{what? No!}}

The door had always been easy to open, at least for him --- Arya had disagreed vehemently --- and although now it felt quite a lot harder, Gendry \emph{had} been hammering on an anvil everyday for half his life. The wood gave a sort of screeching noise in protest before sliding open, if only a little. Reaching his hand through, he found the missing chair barring it from the other side and pushed it away.

Finally, it fell open. Behind was a mess, as if someone hadn't really cared for the room in quite some while. Gendry felt he shouldn't be so surprised; Arya certainly wouldn't clean it up, and her maid likely hadn't put a toe inside the chamber ever since her lady was back.

Stepping past the chair over the sadly-looking remains of what might once have been a truly lovely piece of meat --- suddenly he realized he hadn't broken his fast yet --- he came around the half-wall that hid Arya's bed from the door.

\enquote {Ah, yes, I can see how \emph{all right} you are, m'lady.}

She lay there, looking sickly with much paler skin than he remembered, looking sort-of like some of the children he'd seen in the City, the ones that lived in the streets without any food for a week, slowly starving away.

Also, it looked as if she'd tried to bind herself to the bed. There was a string --- probably from all that stuff that ladies had to have around for needlework, she'd complained about having to keep it more than once --- around her left wrist connecting her with framework that the mattress lay on, and something along her right as well, though it didn't look like she'd quite managed to finish it.

\thought {Well, I imagine it's quite hard to bind your left arm to something when you can't use your right.}

Beside her, on the little bed-side table lay a piece of parchment which had her scrawling all over it, with things crossed out and corrected and crossed out again.

\enquote {I tried to write a letter}, she told him, obviously following his eyes, \enquote {to Jon, or maybe Robb. It didn't work, I can't really write with my right, and I didn't know what to put in it anyways.}

Kneeling down beside her, he took a longer look at it. Even now he wasn't able to make out its meaning, used as he was to the pretty writing in the library's books, but he \emph{was} fairly certain that some of the letters where the wrong way round.

\enquote {Someone's teaching you how to read?}

He gave a nod, not sure what else to do.

\enquote {Good.}

It took him a moment before he could speak again, to take all this in. His had was hurting, and if Arya had been normal, she'd have probably said that he had his \enquote {thinking-face} on.

\enquote {Arya, what is all that?}, he asked her, pointing to the messy bound she'd made around her arm.

\enquote {I didn't want to hurt anyone, not again. Isn't that what you do, with monsters? Chaining them up?}

If there was one thing that frightened him it was more the tone of her voice --- sincere, as sure of herself as she'd ever been, but also meek, and resigned --- than what she \emph{could} do to hurt someone.

\enquote {So you've been here all this time?}

\enquote {Mostly, yes. There's a chamber pot beneath the bed, I can get it out with my right. And seeing as I am a \emph{princess}} --- she made it more sound more like a snort than a word --- \enquote {they bring me food in here, too. But I can look out of the window. I watched you there, down in the yard, practising.}

That brought a smile to his face, and he almost thought he could see her share it, but wasn't quite sure of it. Then he remembered that she'd tried to chain herself up, and stopped.

\enquote {Why? Arya. I know you, you wouldn't hurt anyone who doesn't deserve it.}

There was silence again, a bitter, cold and sad one. When she spoke again, she'd managed the seemingly impossible and made her voice go even weaker.

\enquote {I'm not sure of that anymore, Gendry. When I was there, in the battle … I rode on Nymeria, you know, with Needle in my hand, and ---}

\enquote {I found it in the chamber outside,} he interrupted her, before she had to say any more.

\enquote {Yes. I threw it away, too. That's why I was writing that letter, to explain to Jon why I'd done that.}

\thought {She throws the sword away, and then worries about explaining to her brother as to why? And she's afraid of hurting someone?}

Gendry silently cursed himself for not having come sooner.

\enquote {Has anyone else been here? Besides whoever brings the food in?}

Silence, this time of the purely uncomfortable kind, then: \enquote {My mother, once. I almost chased her out. After that I remembered that I still had the string and …}

\enquote {Made this}, he pointed to her wrist.

\enquote {Yes.}

Gendry had to sit down on the floor, his head felt all dizzy and confused. Looking beside him, he found the abandoned meal lying on the floor. At a rough guess, not even a quarter of it was gone.

\enquote {You really should eat more}, he told her.

\enquote {I know. I tried, but I just can't … It makes me think too much of the meat Nymeria always brought us.}

Gendry nodded, then took the knife lying there with the plate. Again kneeling beside the bed, he brought it to the string Arya had bound herself with, but her other hand caught him before he'd reached it. He wondered why that surprised him. She'd always been quicker than him, after all.

\enquote {Seriously, Arya, but this is \emph{wrong}.}

Her hand never wavered.

\enquote {Who are you to tell me that? You're from King's Landing, you wanted to be a knight; imagine you'd succeeded. Maybe you'd have been there. Probably there were other people there, people like you, and I've killed them. \emph {All} of them. So who are you, to tell me that?}

\enquote {Your friend}, Gendry answered.

\enquote {What I did was \emph{wrong},} she insisted.

He could see she was close to tears now; if it had been him, he suspected he'd have broken already, but of course Arya had always been tougher than he was.

\enquote {I didn't say it was right, Arya. Just … you know, the Blackfish told me that to be a knight doesn't mean that you're great at fighting, it means that you know when \emph{not} to fight.}

\enquote {Well, I can't ever be a knight, can I? Maybe that's why I didn't know.}

This was one of these queer statements she made from time to time, the kind where he wasn't sure if she meant it or was joking.

\enquote {But you do know now.}

He tried to smile at her, and for a moment was sure there was something --- just a slight twitch --- in the corners of her mouth, too.

\enquote {You remember? What we promised each other, when we were on the run?} He waited a moment, until she gave a light nod. \enquote {You'll always be Arya to me, no matter what. And you \emph{are} Arya, and you're definitely not some monster, you're definitely not one of these witches from the stories, and you know why?}

\enquote {Why?}, she whispered, just barely audible.

\enquote {Because you admit that you were wrong.}

She sunk back into the bed for a moment, and while Gendry was starting to wonder if maybe something of the cold food lying around was still edible, if maybe he could get her to eat it --- she really was in need of a meal; years on the street had made him all too familiar with how starving people looked like --- when she said:

\enquote {You know all that means nothing, don't you? Even if I feel bad about it, it doesn't help those who're already dead.}

\enquote {No}, he agreed, \enquote {But it helps all those that won't die because you won't do it again, even if they never know of it.}

Silence fell on them, then, and though it wasn't quite the warm kind of it they'd shared so often above a campfire or even in this very room between two stories, it certainly felt more comfortable than the one Gendry had found when he'd shoved open the door.

After some time, she let his arm go, and he cut the string in half. Secretly, he was almost sure she was glad of it; not at least she couldn't do any more needlework any more.

They sat together in silence for a while. Finally, Arya asked if he didn't have duties to attend, and that he really shouldn't get himself into trouble because of her ---

\enquote {Arya, I'm not living in the forge anymore. You know … that letter you left, before … well, the King --- er, your brother --- he read it. The Blackfish took me on as squire.}

Suddenly, as if the sun had come forth behind a cloud and was now streaming into the room, there was a smile on Arya's face.

\enquote {Took them long enough. And … I'm sorry that you were in the dungeon because of me.}

\enquote {Wasn't your fault, Arya.}

\enquote {Still, I'm sorry.}

Maybe that shouldn't mean as much to him as it did, because obviously, it \emph{hadn't} been her fault. Still, in some way, it mattered more than his sudden status as a squire. Much more.

\enquote {So? If you're a squire now, shouldn't you … I don't know, be outside in the yard or something?}

\enquote {Yeah. Probably I should be outside, learning to ride. I'm still horrible at it,} he admitted.

\enquote {I remember. Never met anyone so scared of a horse.} No smile, this time, but since what she'd said almost amounted to a joke Gendry decided that counted, too.

There was a moment of silence as Gendry refused to move.

\enquote {Really, Gendry, you should go. You'll get in trouble otherwise.}

Still not going, Gendry asked her: \enquote {What about you?}

\enquote {Me?}

\enquote {You know, Arya, it's still early. The sun's barely up. There'll be something to eat in the great hall.}

There was confusion in her face, and maybe a little hint of sadness. Or possibly fear. Or both

\thought {She's still afraid of herself}, he suddenly realized.

\enquote {Ah, right … I won't go to riding-training if you don't go to eat something?}

Now there was definitely confusion on her face.

\enquote {They wouldn't want me there, anyways. Not after ---}

\enquote {Arya, stop that! Stop saying that everybody's afraid of you, or hates you or some such, it's not true! If you'd have ever actually been out there you'd have noticed that they \emph{miss} you.}

Stunned silence, then:

\enquote {Really?}

There was no hint of irony in her voice; she was, he realized, genuinely surprised.

\enquote {Yes!}, he cried out, now more than a little confused himself. \enquote {Sorry}, he added, once he'd noticed how load he'd just shouted.

Slowly, silence fell again, sank into the chamber as if somebody had tried to lay a blanket over it.

\thought {Well, if so, it's certainly a nice blanket}, Gendry thought.

It really was the more comfortable kind of quietness. And to his surprise, after some time, Arya nodded, and slowly tried to climb out of the bed. She was shivering from hunger, he saw, and should really have a change of clothes, but right now he didn't care.

Together they made their way out of her chambers --- the maid cried out in astonishment at seeing her lady leaving it --- and down the corridor and stairs. Soon enough she walked on her own, and there was even something of the almost-always running old Arya to her steps.

They parted ways at the great Hall's entrance --- she in, to break her fast, if somewhat belatedly, he out again, to face the Blackfish's shouting that must undoubtedly follow his lateness.

What he hadn't expected was to find that his master was missing. Horren, the stableboy sitting at the door, refused to tell him a thing on what was going on. Not mush later the missing knight arrived, took a look at Gendry, said \enquote {There you are, boy!} but then left it at that.

Gendry never asked, but he suspected the man had been checking on his niece.

The following days he gave up on ever finding anything useful in Maester Vyman's library. It might well be that there \emph{was} a text explaining exactly what he'd needed to know, but he felt it wasn't really likely he'd ever stumble across it, what with half a page a day being the fastest he could decipher all these letters.

Of course, that left him with free mornings.

Which in turn meant that he was much more likely to have time to see Arya. And now that he'd actually gotten himself to visit her once, he didn't seem to be able to stop again.

For her part, Arya was happy to see him, most times. Or as happy as Arya ever was, these days, but still. Sometimes they both tried to pretend that nothing had ever happened, though normally that didn't really work. Still, they made progress. Arya started to be at meals more and more, and Gendry found he was less haunted by the wolves, howling, than he'd been before.

Sometimes one of them --- or both at the same time --- would slip back and not say a word to the other in a day, but only sometimes.

Two days after he'd first visited her, Hot Pie suddenly found himself called in by the castle's steward, assigned to work in the kitchen. Both Arya and Gendry agreed --- and told him, too --- that the castle's food had started to taste a little better, even the simple stews they served the smallfolk.


% Hot Pie turning up, after the epilogue of the first part.

% Asks him about Arya, Gendry realizes that, though she's never been far from his mind, he hasn't directly thought of her for some time and hasn't spoken with her since she returned.

% Tells the Blackfish (he's a sort of father, I'd say), who encourages him to go.

% Visiting Arya and discussing moral rights and wrongs. She again condemns what was done to him.

% Arya tells him of how the direwolves were originally found, and she wonders what their true porpuse was, and whether or not she might have fulfilled it already, as a sort of argument against further contact.

% Maybe Arya having restrained herself? Wondering whether or not she should slip into Nymeria to make her stop, or if it would lead her further down into madness.

% Gendry repeats the original promise of "you'll always be Arya to me". She's still undecided, though, and he leaves, but they start up their storytelling again











\chapter*{Bran}

\chbegin {H}{eaven was falling, and Bran with it.} Clouds and dust, monsters and terrors quietly hushed by, short glimpses out into the bright eternal darkness, while he fell through the fog of dreams.

A flash and a bird's cry, and he stood on firm and solid ground, or ground that appeared to be solid.

\emph{Here}, in this case, was somewhere before a bright and towering castle, as ancient as anything could ever be.

For a moment, Bran thought the walls were leaking blood from within. Something terrible must've happened to it.

\thought {No}, he realized. What coloured his sight in red wasn't blood at all; instead, the entire intricate stonework was overgrown tightly; covered deeply in the millennia that had quietly gone by. It was like eternity itself had come to hug the walls and squeeze them almost to the point of breaking.

If there was anything else to this world, then it was concealed, hidden from view by an all-powerful veil, or maybe by the mist, and the fog.

Thunder reached his ears, and slowly it lifted and distance was revealed to him.

The sky above him was white, and stark, and threatening.

On the fields around him, wooden poles stood, a boy or girl impaled on each of them. Their blood had watered the ground for a very long time. The secret lands of greenseers was red, it appeared.

\thought {I've been here before,} Bran thought.

The dreamer looked up and around him.

A gigantic weirwood towered above him, ancient and surprisingly faceless. Looking around again, Bran understood. It was sustained by the dreamers who had come before, by those who'd seen and died of it. The closer to the tree, the older the men and women whom the bodies on the spikes had belonged to. It had some sort of a beauty to it, he was sure, but he wasn't quite certain if he'd seen it.

There was a crow sitting on its lower branches, far enough away that he was barely able to discern it in the leaves as a bird and not a simple black spot.

\enquote {North}, it thundered, more in his head then in this weird world, \enquote {You have to go north.}

So Bran went north.

The lands he crossed were strange; as if someone had taken everything he knew, taken it apart and put it back together again, but slightly wrong. Every glance showed him things that weren't quite as they were supposed to be: a bush of red grass, a two trees joining in the air, a brook flowing up the hill. Little things, but all unsettling, and taken together they frightened him more than he would care to admit.

He couldn't help feeling that there was something giant and threatening looming far above it him, and above the world.

But whenever he looked, there was just the ice-white sky, staring blankly back at him.

The crow had followed him, too, and Bran could see it had three eyes, gleaming and staring demandingly at him.

He was afraid.

He continued to go north.

Finally he reached the wall. It was here, too, just not how he'd imagined it. It was not merely a wall; it seemed more that the world made a turn side-ways and continued upwards into endless space and heights. No matter how far he stretched his dreamer's head, there was no upper bound to it. It might disappear into the mist, be Bran knew all the same that even beyond that there was never an end to it. The Wall made its presence known in a way that only infinite things could ever conceive. Only one thing had ever felt remotely like it to Bran, and that was staring off into the stars at night, and even then it hadn't been nearly as powerful.

To all directions, it continued without bounds, a solid block of something that was clearly ice and somehow wasn't. Maybe if someone had put the ice on fire and let it burn low, just before it went out, it would've looked like this. If so, then in some places the wall was burning high and proud.

And in others it had burned itself out, until it stood just on the brink of extinction. In too many places it was fully dark already, or as dark as ice can ever be, and a coldness streamed out from it that Bran had felt before but once.

The whole thing not merely seemed impassable; somehow, Bran knew it truly \emph{was} impossible for anything to break through it, as impossible as it was for him ever to walk again when he was awake.

At that thought he involuntarily looked down upon himself, and found he was as whole as he'd ever been, with both legs working properly. He wondered why he hadn't wondered about how he was walking before.

\thought {I can't break through this}, he thought, \thought {No one can.}

\enquote {No one}, agreed the crow, its voice a thunder across the dream-land, \enquote {but there are ways through it, hidden, locked. Find one, and you will pass.}

\enquote {Why? Why should I want to pass?}

\enquote {You know why,} the wind sang, \enquote {You've seen what lays beyond already.}

Lights danced and the Wall flickered, slightly but ominously. It seemed imaginable that it could ever fail, but the signs of it were clearly there to see for all who cared to look. Not that many ever did.

Bran nodded, and began his search.

Close to it everything was bright and glowing and unnatural; whenever he came within what he judged to be arm's reach --- it was hard to be sure; he didn't want to touch the Wall, and it always seemed like it could be right there or miles away --- then his whole field of view would turn into one solid block of lightning shaped and carved into bricks.

At least, that was true of the parts that were still well-maintained.

Other parts were black as the night, and still others almost translucent. Bran didn't look at them; he didn't need to. He'd seen the Heart of Winter when he'd been here before, and there was no need to stare into it again.

At first he hadn't noticed, but slowly it seemed to him that he wasn't the only thing at the wall. Here and there, little flocks of small black birds had made their nest along its length.

\thought {Crows,} he knew them.

\thought {The Night's Watch.}

When finally he found a gate he almost missed it, so well had it been hidden. Not a single difference was there that he could spot or smell or touch and yet Bran knew it was close. There were guards, too, but he felt them weaken in his presence.

\thought {No}, he noted, \thought {they weaken in the three-eyed crow's presence, not mine.}

The bird was still with him, watching his every move.

Bran stepped in front of the gate, and it opened. Terrors lay beyond; he could see them, \emph{feel} them.

Silence engulfed the world.

Everything seemed to be waiting, waiting for him to decide.

The air felt thick and frozen, as if someone was halting it in place.

Until, far in the distance, a terrible cry shattered the silence and left it in pieces.

Bran turned around to see from whence it came, and everything was dark. The world rushed away from him and left him behind. No. \emph{He} was leaving \emph{it} behind.

What seemed like an eternity later, Brandon Stark opened his eyes.

The darkness engulfed him here, too, but it was of a more comfortable, familiar kind. He could just spy a stone statue --- and with this one, everything was right in the place it ought to be --- and something bright and blinding … after some while, he could make out a candle bravely fighting against the night, shining on the girl who was holding it.

\thought {Good Morning, my prince,} she greeted him, then frowned. \thought {I think it is morning, at least …}

\thought {Meera,} he knew her. \thought {The crypts, yes …}

They'd been here for a long time, it seemed.

\thought {But it stood there, proud and tall,} he remembered the tall castle in his dream, \thought {ancient and powerful.}

What else could it have been but Winterfell in all its ancient glory? It had looked different, sure, but Bran knew it had also been the same as well.

\enquote {Jojen? Osha?}, he called. \enquote {I think it's time to go up out again.}

He'd dreamed it true. After Hodor had carried him up they found Winterfell there, whole and true again, with the Direwolf of Stark flying proudly above the gate. For a moment everything seemed as if nothing had ever been amiss, before the people of the castle realized who had appeared in their midst. Soon they were cheering and dancing and seemed unable to stop again.

\thought {Let them be happy}, Bran thought, who knew nothing was over yet \thought {let them be happy now, before they can't be anymore.}

One look at Jojen told him the other boy had thought the same. Osha was just happy for the daylight, it seemed, but then she couldn't see the way Bran could see, or Jojen. Rickon had joined the celebrating castle folk. But Meera stayed behind, looking at her brother, worry on her face. Hodor was hodor.

In the great Hall they found Maester Luwin, and Ser Rodrick, too, and momentarily pretended that nothing had happened. Thankfully, no one mentioned the boys' heads that had been displayed in front of the gates --- Bran knew of them, of course, but he hadn't told anyone else yet. Jojen might have dreamt of them, but the others didn't have to learn of those boys just yet.

\thought {I wonder who they were, who had to die in place of us.}

He swore himself to find that out once he was once more the Stark in Winterfell. If they'd had to die for him and Rickon, at least their names should be remembered well.

Even if it might seem that way, all was not perfect. Of course it never was, but this was not as close as Bran would've hoped. Over the following days he learnt from Maester Luwin that Reek was still alive, for one, and that it had turned out he'd tricked Ser Rodrick and was actually Lord Bolton's bastard Ramsey, the one who'd made Lady Hornwood eat her own fingers, as well.

\enquote {Why hasn't anyone sentenced him?,} he demanded.

\thought {My father showed me how to do it.} He probably would have to change the words somewhat to include Robb in place of Robert Baratheon, and use another sword --- a cripple like him could hardly lift a greatsword, after all, and anyways Ice was still stolen by the Lannisters --- but he'd do it himself, if needs be.

\enquote {Ser Rodrick would've done so already, if I hadn't stopped him.}

\enquote {\emph{You?}} Bran exclaimed, shock in his voice.

\enquote {He has well over a thousand of his father's men at his command. If he dies … who knows what they'll do to Winterfell?}

It took Bran a moment before understanding dawned. \thought {He's afraid}, he realized. The Maester had lived through the whole of Theon's occupation, had maybe even seen the boys at the gate die, of course he was afraid.

Not that he was alone with that. \thought {I've lived for weeks in a grave, I understand.} He wondered if he should say that out loud, but decided it would sound all stupid and childish, not something the ruling Prince of Winterfell was supposed to say. So instead, Bran hoped his face showed enough of how he thought.

\enquote {But has to die, surely. What will Robb say if he's ---}

\thought {Oh.}

The next day Bran had Ramsey Snow arrested and put into a dungeon, to await King Robb's justice. The bastard's men stirred and some were heard complaining, but nothing more; it was hard, not to say suspicious, to argue against the king's justice, after all, and much harder than against a castellan's or even a prince's.

He'd half wanted to make it the same gruff cell the man had once been in as Reek, but Maester Luwin cautioned him, and instead sent him into a cell fit for a noble's son, if not quite for a lord. Too many say him as a saviour of Winterfell, and too many would look at other actions doubtfully. Bran tried and failed to understand how anyone could think that brutish-looking monster anything else then a creature that would've been at home in Old Nan's stories.

Ser Rodrick, for his part, appeared thankful that \emph{something} had happened. Bran wondered why the man hadn't done anything by himself; after all, the Castellan of Winterfell was not bound to the Maester's counselling.

\thought {Maybe he's afraid, too}, Bran thought. He remembered what his father had told him once, about fear and bravery.

Bran was very afraid.

He dearly hoped that what he did was brave as well.

But while he spend his days worrying, his nights belonged to the dreams. Now that he could slip into Summer whenever he wanted  --- he'd learnt that, too, in the darkness of the crypts --- it seemed that he'd stopped doing it in his sleep, and instead would find himself in the dream-world.

Most every morning he'd wake to the same memories of making his way to the impossible thing that was the Wall and being stopped by the scream at the last moment. It took him days before he realized that it wasn't a \emph{frightening} scream; instead, it was a \emph{frightened} one, a scream of terror.

Once he knew that, he tried to go find it instead. Ignoring the crow which would be pecking at him all the way wasn't easy, not even in this dream where he still had both his legs to run, but eventually he managed.

In his dreams the south was full of mist and fog, streaming from great wide rivers that he crossed without thinking. Sometimes, in the distance, there appeared to be a looming tower, or maybe a mountain, impossibly old.

Occasionally there was a weirwood, though not as often as in the North. More often there would be nothing left but stumps all staring sadly at the passing dreamer; once, Bran found a ring of them, twenty at the least, all cut down long ago.

It took him many nights to find what he was looking for.

The scream grew closer then, but in a way that didn't help to locate it. Though sometimes it would now be accompanied by wailing, too. Hushing figures would surround him, like ghosts or demons, not many of them human. Most had four legs and appeared to be running. He thought he recognized at least one of them, but never could be sure.

And at last he found her, though by that time she'd stopped crying. A girl, maybe a year or two older than he was himself, staring out into the dream-world.

\thought {Arya.}

And his dream grind to a screeching halt, as if someone had stopped time itself.

\thought {My sister. I thought you were dead.}

She stared at him.

\thought {I'm not,} came the answer. It wasn't really speech, Bran supposed, and more like she'd decided to share her thoughts with him. If there was any sound to wit of it other than the strange echoing sort of noise it made inside his head, then it was lost on him.

If their form of communication could be considered talking, then Bran supposed they talked for a very long time. He hoped he'd remember all of it once day broke and Measter Luwin had to wake him again.

There was so much that had happened.

There was so much to tell.

The next day he found the names of the two boys who'd died for him and Rickon. Thom and Stevan. He ordered them to be mourned properly, and had their battered remains placed in the servant's graveyard in Winterfell though neither of them had ever set foot within its grounds in life. Their father, it turned out, had been killed by Ramsey Snow as well, but the mother had escaped. He offered her a place within the walls of Winterfell though she declined, not wanting to be so close to the place where her sons had been impaled on spikes. Bran could understand.

And then in the next night, when he was dreaming again, Bran finally went through the hidden gate in the Wall to what lay beyond.




\chapter*{Podrick}

\chbegin {P}{od was used to being ignored,} so being stuck in a cell wasn't really too bad for him. At least it meant that no one was beating him, or laughing at him.

\thought {It could've been worse, really}, he considered, \thought {with Lord Tyrion gone.}

And at least it wasn't one of the black cells. He'd seen them once, when Lord Tyrion had inspected them, and they weren't the kind of place he would have longed to see again. Lord Varys had told them --- or rather, told Lord Tyrion, Pod had just happened to stand nearby --- that a man was more like to die of thirst in them than of the executioner's blade. His uncle's blade.

Although, probably it wasn't his uncle anymore. Stannis was in the city now, no matter how much Lord Tyrion had done to protect it from the pretender, and not even Pod was stupid enough to think he'd go away anytime soon.

He just hoped that \emph{King} Stannis felt the loss of his men sorely and acutely, or else all the work had been for nothing, all the catapults built and all the trouble with the guild of pyromancers.

\thought {The wildfire}, he remembered, \thought {the river on fire, with green flames licking and flickering towards the night-black sky.}

It wasn't the kind of sight he was like to forget, same as Stannis's wobbling boat-bridge, or the sight of his madmen crossing it and storming at him in their rage.

And then there were the shapes of men floating in the water, sometimes still burning.

One man in particular, of course. A knight, impaled on a spear a boy had thrust at him, his once white cloak turned red and muddy, floating around him. A sword splashing into the black and gulping water after it had left a bloody gash in his lord's face.

He hadn't \emph{meant} to kill the man, he truly hadn't, but Pod couldn't have Lord Tyrion die on him, either.

He'd been kind to him, after all. Kinder than he had ever been used to.

Podrick hoped he was well. They'd managed to reach the riverbank again; or rather, he'd managed it with Lord Tyrion's small body flung over his shoulder, desperate not to fall and drown with every step. But soon after he'd stumbled back on the rocky beach his strength had left him, leaving his memories patchy at best, with gaping holes in them.

Vaguely, like through a thick layer of mist, he recalled someone picking him up, and a moving mouth hovering above him. Maybe it had been shouting. \thought {Yes}, he thought, \thought {it must have been shouting. Shouting for someone else to come.}

When you found Lord Tyrion lying around, you weren't like to ignore it, after all, nor the boy holding him in his arms.

Probably someone had seen the Payne sigil on his tunic, or maybe the Lannister lion on his meagre armour (really, it had just been a helmet and some chain-mail that hardly deserved the name) and taken him back to the Red Keep. He was, at least, fairly sure that this was were he was now. At least, it seemed like the walls were very slightly red.

As dungeons went, he'd gotten the softer side of them, he supposed. It was small, yes, but not completely black --- there was a small hole in the wall opposite the door, letting the sun shine in, though it wasn't big enough for him to get a clear view outside --- and not quite as filthy and reeking as some other places he'd been. Apparently he'd been judged important enough to warrant his own cell, too. That was something he wasn't used to. No one ever thought him important, not even the least bit.

Once a day the door would be opened half-way, and he'd receive this day's ration of bread and water. Although it wasn't much, he never ate it all at once; he'd learnt long ago that it wasn't any good only eating once a day. Of course it was the same amount if he split it to two or three smaller meals a day, but it somehow \emph{felt} as if it was more, and that was really all that mattered.

He didn't count the days, though. That way, he could always tell himself that he'd only been here a relatively short time. And since the days never changed, it was easy enough to loose track.

It was on his fourth day, then, that they came for him and took him to the new king. At least he told himself that it was the fourth day. He suspected that it had been the forth day yesterday, too, and the day before that, and probably some more days even before that.

While the guards brought him towards the great hall, for the first time Pod could see where he'd been for so long. He'd been right guessing that it was the Red Keep and not some other place in King's Landing. His cell was in one of the outer side-wings, one of the attachments that had been added after Meagor the Cruel's time. If one looked closely it was still easy to see where the original outer wall had been breached and redirected. The Red Keep truly was nothing if not huge, and from there it took them quite some time before they reached Maegor's holdfast, the castle-within-a-castle that kept the heart of the realm.

He tried to see how much damage had been dealt to the walls during the battle, and found it to be not as much as he'd expected to see.

\thought {But it's called Aegon's \emph{high} hill for a reason}, he reminded himself. Few catapults or trebuchets, none of them practical on a ship, could have flung anything that seriously threatened the Keep itself.

\thought {And Stannis wanted to take it, too, not destroy it.} Lord Tyrion had said that Stannis was nothing if not intelligent and just, and neither would make him want to deal damage he'd have to pay right afterwards.

The previously ever-present Lannister crimson was gone, of course. Although Pod wasn't too sure if he could tell the exact difference between Lannister crimson and the red Stannis himself used on his banner, for the burning heart of his queer Asshai'i god.

What \emph{had} changed, though, was the newly-erected pile of wood in front of the gates to the inner castle. Apparently it had been built on a foundation made of ashes.

\thought {Lord Varys said that Stannis worshipped demons}, he reminded himself. A nightfire, then, to be lit by sundown, built on the remnants of yesterday's. He'd heard tales of them; half the keep had constantly been whispering about what Stannis and his red queen were doing.

He wondered if it wouldn't be better to use all the wood for rebuilding the damage done to the city.

Inside Meagor's Holdfast, though, the change was more noticeable. While life had seemingly returned quickly to the court, the people he saw where all strangers. Even some of the servants were new; Stannis had obviously been very thorough.

On the gates to the Great Hall now proudly hung a crowned stag within its burning heart.

But the throneroom itself had stayed the same, no matter how many queer demonic symbols Stannis had put on the walls, or how many golden crowned stags framed the windows.

Because \emph{nothing} would ever have the power to change the monstrosity that was the Iron Throne. Podrick had known that when he'd first laid his eyes on it, years ago, and knew it was just as true now. The black mass of iron and steel would loom above this hall as long as King's Landing itself would stand.

A new set of knights stood there to guard it, of course, though curiously they didn't appear to wear any white cloaks. The normally ever-present Lords Littlefinger and Varys were gone as well. Littlefinger's absence was no surprise, he had, after all, abandoned them for the Tyrells and was probably still with them, but Lord Varys … \thought {either he's been executed or else has fled.} Given the Spider's whispered knowledge of the Red Keep's secret passages, Pod suspected the latter.

But other than that not very much was different now; there was a woman in red next to the throne --- probably the red witch --- but however much she tried, she failed to make much of an impression next to the twenty-feet high pile of molten swords next to her. Even the crowd attending the spectacle was roughly the same size it had been when Joffrey held court. But then, Podrick suspected that this had been going on for days, he'd just been pushed to the end because of course he wasn't anyone important, and by now the city's commoners had tired of the whole thing and gone back to work on rebuilding their burned-out houses.

And one other thing struck him. His uncle was missing.

\thought {What did you expect? Of course he's gone, why would Stannis let him live?}

He felt a blow heavier than he would've thought possible. Ser Ilyn had never really meant much to him, and had never really been there for him, either, but he'd still been the closest Pod had ever come to a family.

Pod could almost feel tears gathering in his eyes, tears he would've never expected.

\thought {No, no, not now, I can't cry now, not with all these people ---} Luckily, he got it under control. Mostly. He'd learnt long ago what happened to boys who cried when people were staring at them.

And right now, it was King Stannis who stared at him. With a start, Pod realized he hadn't knelt in front of him, and almost threw himself on the ground.

\thought {Please don't kill me, please don't kill me, please don't kill me …}

\enquote {Will you be loyal to Stannis of the House Baratheon, the first of his name, King of the Andaly, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm?}

Pod was grateful that it hadn't been Stannis who had spoken, until he realized it had been the Red Woman instead. Somewhere his mind was wondering what had happened to \enquote {Defender of the Faith}, but that part quickly found itself drowned out.

Though Pod was already kneeling, he tried to bow as deeply as possible without falling over, before saying, as loud and clearly as he could manage, \enquote {Yes, your Grace.}

It hadn't been King Joffrey he'd been loyal to, anyway, but Lord Tyrion, who had never really been too loyal to his nephew, either. Of course Lord Tyrion was likely dead, too, come to think of it.

He'd hoped that it would be enough to just accept Stannis as his king, but after that the questions began. Did he know that Joffrey and his siblings had been abominations and born of incest between Cersei and Jaime Lannister, against all laws of God?

\enquote {Yes, your Grace.}

Silently he hoped the past tense only applied to Joffrey, and not to Tommen and Myrcella as well, but of course he couldn't ask. \thought {At least Myrcella must be alive}, he told himself, \thought {she's in Dorne, after all. And Lord Tyrion had Tommen hidden in someplace safe, too.} Not even he knew where exactly that was.

Before he could think any further, the next question came. Did he have even an inkling of where Lord Tyrion might be now, or had he helped him escape?

Grateful that he didn't have to lie, he said \enquote {No, your Grace. I was with him when the battle ended, but after that I only woke up already back in the Keep.} He hoped it wasn't too obvious that this was happy news for him; already he started wondering how his lord might have escaped, and \emph{where.}

Then they told him that his uncle was dead. Of course he'd suspected that already, but hearing it said out loud somehow made it hurt more; it was almost like Ser Ilyn had died in exactly the instant the word left the witch's mouth.

Resolutely, Pod continued to fight his eyes who still resolutely insisted on starting to cry. There was also an urge to flee, to run away, and he tried his hardest to oppress that as well. He was in it deep enough already, there was no need to create further trouble.

\thought {Don't kill me, don't kill me, don't kill me …}

Finally, Stannis himself opened his mouth and proclaimed a verdict. Pod listened to the words so intently to it that he immediately forgot them again, and only the gist of it remained, but that was enough.

\thought {You're hearby sentenced to die,} was all he would ever remember of this day.

\thought {Don't kill me, don't kill me, don't kill ---}

It felt like running against a wall, Pod supposed. He actually found himself struggling not to fall over on the hard marble ground.

\thought {Death.}

He could see the Stranger in front of him, reaching for him, reaching like a snake for him …

\thought {I don't want to die,} he thought. But what was there he could do?

Lord Tyrion had once said that his mind was his weapon. Pod had been his squire. So the only weapon he could possibly have was his own mind, thick and slow as it might be.

\thought {Think!}

What to do in face of a death sentence? He remembered that Lord Tyrion had once demanded trial by combat, but who'd fight for him, unimportant boy that he was?

Did he know anyone who'd ever tricked an executioner?

Anyone who'd somehow manage to elude death?

\emph {Anything?}

Looming despair flooded through him, his every bone feeling cold and hard and immovable.

No one ever escaped the King's Justice, because otherwise, what would be the point? Even the great Lord Stark, Hand of the King, had ended under his uncle's blade, just like any other …

\thought {Wait.}

\enquote {Your Grace,} he began, his voice shaking.

\enquote {Your Grace,} he repeated, trying to make it sound steadier, \enquote {I will accept your sentence if that is your wish; however, I feel I would serve this realm better if you were to allow me to join the Night's Watch.}

His words were like magic.

And a week later the world found him on a ship northwards, together with a hundred others who'd thought of the same way out, frozen to the bone, but wonderfully \emph{alive.}



\chapter*{Catelyn}

% Meeting Stannis, news of Frey's treachery (exposed by Roose); Winterfell retaken by Ramsey, Robb marching North.

% Tyrells have declared independence and now have to fight against civil war breaking out (with Fossoways etc.), tie it in with the main theme; at least Stannis doesn't send a shadow to kill her in the night.

% King's Landing in chaos after the wildfire; Stannis residing in the Red Keep, seeing Sansa again, pretending to demand for Arya


\chapter*{Sansa}

% Going home?

% Ser Dontos? Littlefinger exposed by her mother, Ser Dontos?

% Again hope at the prospect of leaving this place, though fear, too, at seeing Arya and Robb again (especially Arya, who she might have killed. The walls have ears, Cat can't tell her yet).


\chapter*{Gendry}

\chbegin {I}{t had taken them almost a week}, but at last Arya and Gendry were talking --- carefully, but surely --- about the wolves rampaging outside of Riverrun, and why they might be doing that.

\enquote {They're wolves,} Arya said, \enquote {Of course they're doing that.}

While some time had passed since then, Gendry still remembered her scoffing at the very idea of wolves hurting men, back when Yoren had still been alive. She'd almost caused an inn brawl, after all. Though of course he didn't tell her that, and anyway he suspected that she knew all the same. She'd been the one to say it, after all.

Arya swore him that she'd never been inside Nymeria since she'd come back, even in the week they both determinedly refused to talk about, or even mention, when they'd both hidden from the other. Of course there was no need for her to swear any oaths to make him believe her, and he said so, but Arya brushed that away. He half-suspected she did it for herself, but didn't ask.

It was only a day later when an idea decided to pop into Gendry's head, at the most unexpected of moments --- in fact, he'd been talking with, or rather listening to, Hot Pie endlessly chattering about different kinds or beans and turnips and how they tasted differently. The boy somehow managed to excel all of his previous conversations with him in that regard; apparently he was now learning how to cook. That had confused Gendry somewhat, and he said so, but Hot Pie explained that in King's Landing he'd only ever been a baker, and though of course he'd known something of cooking as well, this was the first time he learnt it \emph{properly}, whatever that meant.

Not that Gendry had time to wonder, because he was suddenly springing up from his seat and running away, fearing he'd forget his thought a minute later.

Bursting through Arya's chamber-door, he found her sitting on the chair she'd once bolted her door with, reading a book that seemed vaguely familiar to him.

\thought {It's one of those thrice-damned paper-heaps that had \emph{warg} in the title but didn't loose a word about the matter on the actual pages.}

\enquote {Gendry!}, she exclaimed, surprised and confused, \enquote {I --- I don't understand, did something happen?}

\enquote {Just had an idea,} he told her, hurriedly, \enquote {Ahm … you can --- you can sort of \emph{go} into Nymeria's mind and make her do what you want, don't you?}

\enquote {I told you already, I haven't done that!}

That was Gendry's point exactly.

\enquote {Yes? Well, I think maybe you should. You could go into her and make the wolves \emph{stop} hunting people.}

Her face, Gendry supposed, looked a bit as if someone had moulded it into shape and it got stuck.

At last she snapped out of it, changed her face to an expression of utter bewilderment and got promptly stuck again.

It felt like days later when she finally said, in that precise calm and somewhat quiet tone she always used when she was afraid, \enquote {What?}

In the following few moments, Gendry suddenly understood what she meant with his \enquote {thinking-face}. Hers was quite extraordinary, but then, with Arya no one could expect anything normal.

At last she found her voice again.

\enquote {Have you gone mad?}

\thought {Maybe.}

They spoke no more of that then, at least not on that particular day. Gendry had work to do, obviously, and she had found something to do, too --- apparently she was helping the steward, that man Utherydes Wayn, with some records. When he'd taken a look at it, once, it had seemed all just long lists of numbers arranged in something of a grid, and Arya would sit there, thinking, and slowly adding another row to it.

Even she herself said that it was distressingly boring, but it was important, and it gave her something to do she didn't have to leave her chambers for that wasn't needlework. As much as he wished otherwise, while Arya would show up at meals, and sometimes, very occasionally, in the yard or the godswood, she still wasn't close to the girl she'd been before.

Although he suspected that she'd befriended her maid, but after previously complaining about her to him now didn't want to admit it. Or else she was just playing that strange board-and-figurines game with herself, and Bertha's bettering mood had some other cause.

Them not talking about it didn't mean it was forgotten, though. In fact, it seemed more like they were both constantly having it in their minds now, even if they never told each other of it. On occasion he'd catch her deep in thought, just staring at a wall, when he came to visit her; and more than once he'd been struck by the Blackfish's wooden sword because his mind wasn't really attending his hands.











\chapter*{Gendry, other stuff.}


\chbegin {N}{early a week passed} before Arya felt up to it. Gendry might've hoped that it wouldn't take this long, but he couldn't really fault her. He'd just heard the wolves howling, she'd \emph{made} them. \thought {Surely}, he thought, \thought {that's quite a difference.}

They were in her bedchamber again, although it was now only barely recognizable as the place where he'd found Arya trying to chain herself up. The walls might still be the same, yes, and the same furniture, too --- even the chair was still there, although now it was for him to sit on, not for blocking the door --- but not much else had stayed the same. No half-scrawled letters were lying around, and the plates of cold food on the floor had vanished as well.

And then there was Arya, of course.

She'd changed most of all, in the hours and days she'd spend outside. Somehow, she'd actually managed to overcome Hot Pie's suspicion of her, leading to them both talking for hours on end, sometimes. And while Gendry feared she'd never again be the quickly-laughing girl he'd once known --- although he would never give up hoping for that girl to come back --- she \emph{did} crack a smile now and then. Mostly when she was trying to teach him how to read properly.

Although that was always more fun than anything, Gendry \emph{did} feel that he was making progress.

But now they were back here again. He'd noticed that she tended to be more gloomy whenever she was inside her own chambers. Most of their time together they spend either outside or in his ---much smaller, to the point it was cramped with just the two of them --- own chamber for exactly that reason.

\enquote {You all right?}, he asked her.

In response she only nodded.

Arya closed her eyes, and Gendry suddenly felt like a little boy who didn't know what would happen next. Uneasiness and goosebumps ran over him.

They'd agreed she had to do this for quite a while, of course. If there really were wolves running rampant in the lands around Riverrun Arya should at least try to make them stop.

Even Arya had called that a sensible idea.

It had just taken them a week before Arya wasn't too afraid of slipping away anymore. 

\thought {And}, he admitted to himself, \thought {at least a week before I wasn't afraid to visit her.}



% "We just hold. We don't make any plans, we don't try anything clever, we just hold"

% Arya's slipping into Nymeria now and then under Gendry's supervision, he has to wake her up if she's behaving to violently in her sleep.

% Power corrupts (Arya as well as Edmure, the Blackfish and Gendry himself. Or maybe Arya's the one giving the speech, though that seems a tad too early)



\chapter*{Arya} % sort of a union with the chapter that came before

% Acknowledging her connection and responsibity for Nymeria, calling her back, with Gendry as a sort of "Companion" to her "Doctor".

% News of Sansa coming home, and of Robb having reached Winterfell. Bran and Rickon are alive. Some omnious news from Roose, too.

% Sansa finally arrives. Arya knows their relationship is far from perfect, but they've got time to work on it.



\chapter*{Epilogue}

% Arya or Gendry as POV. Or maybe Bran

% Years later, Gendry and Arya (as friends/couple?) in Winterfell; Gendry has replaced Mikken as master smith. Mentions of (a war|political conflict?) with House Bolton (in the past, already delt with).

% riding to the wall (maybe Tommen's there, as a knight of the watch? He might apologize to Sansa for what his brother did, though I don't think that's appropriate).

% Arya with her wolves again, this time for their "true porpuse", as dictated by the Old Gods?

% Rousing speech (by Robb, maybe?)

% "And the fire was filled with fire; the fire of dragons reborn"


% Gendry & Blackfish: You told me once, the important thing in being a knight isn't the fighting, its the \emph{not} fighting, because I didn't want to fight at all anymore
% -- I did
% -- you kept something from me, didn't you?
% -- you mean the part about learning how not to abhor fighting again? I could've told you that, I guess, but would you have believed it possible at the time?
